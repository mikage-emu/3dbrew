USA change-log:

- Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor
  adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience

## System Titles

[CVer](CVer "wikilink") and the mint applet were updated. For USA, EUR,
JPN, and KOR, [Home Menu](Home_Menu "wikilink") was updated.

The TWN update was Old3DS-only, for that only CVer and mint was updated.

### [Home Menu](Home_Menu "wikilink")

The \*only\* changes in Home Menu was that the codebin was updated.
Besides some UTF-16 strings in .(ro)data which gets updated for each
Home Menu version, the only actual changes were with 2 functions:

- L_1bc7f8(previous version is at L_1bc7f8): When writing u64 ~0 in the
  first loop(the loop with 360 iterations), this now writes value 0x1 to
  u8 _this+8. Same change with the code at the end of this function.
- L_1bd8f4(previous version is at L_1bd8e4): Same change with the first
  loop as the above function.

These appear to be for icon handling, but this is very minor since this
is just additional state writing.
