## Change-log

[Official](http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/667/p/430/c/267)
USA change-log:

- Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor
  adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience

## System Titles

[CVer](CVer "wikilink"), [Home Menu](Home_Menu "wikilink"), and the mint
applet were updated.

### Home Menu

Exactly 4 functions were updated, these functions appear to be gfx
related.

## Server-side NNID NVer update

The URL used for NNID login(domain is account.nintendo.net) now returns
a sysupdate-required error when the 3DS sends a NVer value that's older
than the one for X.X.X-28. With this change at the time this update was
released, the installed [NVer](NVer "wikilink") has to be at minimum the
one from [10.2.0-28](10.2.0-28 "wikilink"). This was a server-side
change. This HTTPS request is done by the act sysmodule.

This apparently also affects systems which don't have NNID-linked, it's
unknown when exactly this change was done server-side(it was after v10.3
release at least).
