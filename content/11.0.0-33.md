### NATIVE_FIRM

The ARM9 FIRM section is larger.

The only updated FIRM sysmodules are loader and pm.

svcBackdoor has been removed (on ARM11).

#### loader

Exactly one function was updated: L_140022b8 (same addr as previous
version).

The codebin physical-memory randomization code introduced with
[10.4.0-29](10.4.0-29 "wikilink") was updated so that it's now used for
OoT3D and Cubic Ninja (checked in the same aforementioned order), for
the USA+EUR+JPN titles. This means oot3dhax and ninjhax need to be
updated to handle this. Using the pre-sysupdate exploit versions will
result in the title randomly crashing. However, if you retry enough
times, it should run fine.

#### pm

Two functions were updated for calling a new function for exheader
handling.

This new function at L_101cfc immediately returns when the input
programID isn't a CTR title / Cubic Ninja (USA/EUR/JPN uniqueID). This
function removes all services in the exheader service-access-control
which match services from a blacklist stored in pm-module. This
blacklist contains two services: "<http:C>" and "soc:U".

This breaks QR-code ninjhax with the version available at the time of
sysupdate release, since the QR-code build downloads the payload via
HTTPC.

#### ARM11-kernel

57 functions were updated, 47 of these are the actual functions used for
handling SVCs (see below). The lone function updated with v10.4 was
updated with this version again: Checks were added to make sure all the
previously allocated memchunks are actually located within the requested
memory region. This was implemented with the following checks which are
done for each memchunk separately - right before clearing and mapping
each one to the requested vaddr.

```
if((region_base > memchunk_addr) || ((region_base + region_size) < (memchunk_addr + memchunk_size<<12))) { kernel_panic(); }
```

The actual ToCToU race has not been fixed (see
[memchunkhax2.1](3DS_System_Flaws "wikilink")).

3 new functions used for validation with memory management were added
(kernelpanic() on failure). This is a new security feature for the
kernel heaps. By adding a MAC to the kernel heap
[memchunkhdr](Memory_Management#memoryblockheader "wikilink") they can
detect when it is modified by an outside DMA device
([gspwn](3DS_System_Flaws "wikilink")).

The MAC itself is custom based on xor-rot-sub-mul, and is calculated as
follows (pseudo-code):

```
u32* crypto_state = (u32*) r4; // Safe kernel memory. This is actually the `[`RegionDescriptor`](Memory_Management#regiondescriptor "wikilink")`.
u32* data_ptr = (u32*) lr; // Unsafe FCRAM pointer.
```

```
r0 = crypto_state[16/4] // Load "key".
r1 = crypto_state[20/4]
r2 = crypto_state[28/4]
r3 = crypto_state[24/4]
```

```
for(size_t i=0; i<2; i++) {
    for(size_t j=0; j<5; j++) {
        r0 -= (r1 >>> 3) - data_ptr[j]
        r1 -= (r3 >>> ((r2 & 0xf) + 3)) ^ (r2 >>> ((r0 & 0xf) + 13))
        r3 -= (r2 >>> r0) * r1
        r2 -= (r0 >>> r1) * r3
    }
}
    
// Verify MAC.
if(data_ptr[5] != (r0 ^ r1)) {
    kernel_panic()
}
```

The function which initializes a memalloc heap had a major update (used
for FCRAM memregions and the SlabHeap container). It generates a random
MAC key based on svcGetSystemTick, like this:

```
crypto_state[16/4] = 0 //This is actually the `[`RegionDescriptor`](Memory_Management#regiondescriptor "wikilink")`.
crypto_state[20/4] = 0
crypto_state[24/4] = 0
crypto_state[28/4] = 0
```

```
u32* key = &crypto_state[16/4];
```

```
for(size_t i=0; i<0x40; i++) {
    for(size_t j=0; j<4; j++) { 
        r0 = key[j] - GetSystemTick()
        key[j] = r0 ^ ((r0 >>> 7) - (key[(i+j) % 4] >>> 17))
    }
}
```

However, it's unknown how much the svcGetSystemTick() output really
varies if anything(?) for each hard-boot during initialization of the
heaps.

6 memory management functions were updated to use the above new
functions, these func-calls replaced the validation code previously used
in these functions in some cases. These were also updated for the above
heap security implementation. One function had a validation func-call
added where previously there wasn't any validation done in the beginning
of the function for previous versions.

Another function(L_fff13b68 previously at L_fff13b68) was updated for
offsets it uses, nothing else.

The function handling the arm11kernel exheader descriptors was updated,
if anything changed besides the kernel-version value it seems minor.

The first 47 updated functions are used for the actual SVC handling. It
seems each change just added code at the start of the function for
initializing the output data. This includes SVCs which were already
stubbed. All of the updated SVCs for this, in the same order as the
arm11kernel code binary:

#### Process9

Various data was moved around in the .data section (.data is 0x99C-bytes
smaller than before).

The only actual change in .text was that only one function was updated.
This function is only called by
[AMPXI:InstallTitlesFinish](AMPXI:InstallTitlesFinish "wikilink") and
[AMPXI:InstallTitlesFinishFIRM](AMPXI:InstallTitlesFinishFIRM "wikilink").
Right after the mediatype validation at the very beginning of the
function, a code block was added for the functionality described below
which is only executed on
[retail](CONFIG_Registers#cfg_unitinfo "wikilink").

This AMPXI function will now check the high 6-bits of the
title-version(major-version) of the title to finish-install against a
hard-coded list of (titleID, minimumVersionRequired) pairs. This list is
identical for Old3DS/New3DS Process9. This applies to MSET, Home Menu,
spider, ErrDisp, SKATER, NATIVE_FIRM, and every retail system module.
When the title-version is invalid, this returns the invalid
title-version error(0xD8E08027).

This prevents downgrading on the ARM11 side via AM-service access.

#### New3DS

The arm9loader wasn't changed at all.

Nothing New3DS-only changed in Process9.

### friends-sysmodule

Only the value used for fpdver changed in the codebin, from 5 to 6. This
is not required server-side yet, last checked on May 11, 2016.

### IR-sysmodule

Exactly two functions were updated with the same changes: L_1053b0 and
L_10547c.

When the input value is zero, this now requires bitmask 0x2 to be clear
in a certain state field before passing a ptr to a function, instead of
0x0.

### 0004001B00010802

The 1-byte content of "romfs:/dummy.txt" was changed from '2' to '3'.
