### Nintendo Zone network settings

Most third-party-operated hotspots removed from the list, after the
Nintendo Zone service was officially discontinued at the end of March
2018; curiously, the [already standing out Best
Buy](Nintendo_Zone "wikilink") and a number of Nintendo hotspots are
still listed.

### Home Menu

No changes in European romfs

### System Settings

Network \> Spotpass \> Send system data: "opting out while online also
stops the usage of \[already\] collected data" (or so is claimed)

Network \> Spotpass \> Send system data: renamed from "Send usage data"

Initial setup: "and agree to the privacy policy" added to the EULA
prompt

### Error display/EULA viewer applet

"accept the Nintendo 3DS Service User Agreement and acknowledge the
Privacy Policy" \> "accept the Nintendo 3DS Service User Agreement and
Privacy Policy"

### EULA text

Doesn't claim anymore the right to collect "your name, your address,
birth date, gender".

"If this agreement is terminated, your personal data will be deleted
\[... limitations about eShop records\]"

Other crap hardly any common person cares about in a practical manner.
