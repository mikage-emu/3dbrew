## Change-Log

USA change-log:

- Improvement to system stability and convenience.

Beginning in early 2016, 2.1.0-3 was installed onto the system's NAND as
a necessary installation step for
[arm9loaderhax](3DS_System_Flaws#arm9loader "wikilink"), to retrieve a
console-specific OTP dump. As this firmware naturally didn't release for
any console aside from the CTR-001 Nintendo 3DS, installation on newer
devices nets known issues such as corrupted screen data, softlocks, and
potential to software brick on FTR-001/Nintendo 2DS units upon
formatting the console.
