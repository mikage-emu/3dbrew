CFA](System_Update_CFA "wikilink") starting with "Super Mario 3D Land".

### 00040030

[ErrDisp](ErrDisp "wikilink"), [Home Menu](Home_Menu "wikilink"), and
the Friends-list applet were updated.

### System Modules

The following system modules were updated: codec, HID, PTM, cecd, dlp,
http, NWM, friends, IR, BOSS, news, and NS.

### [FIRM](FIRM "wikilink") and other titles

NATIVE_FIRM and the DS whitelist were updated.

This updated NATIVE_FIRM added support for a new [NCSD](NCSD "wikilink")
flag for gamecard savegames. When this flag\[7\] is set, the new CTR
method is used, and the hashed keyY method implemented since
[2.0.0-2](2.0.0-2 "wikilink") is used. This updated NATIVE_FIRM also
added [EncryptDecryptAes](PSPXI:EncryptDecryptAes "wikilink") support
for keytype8.

The kernels updated with this NATIVE_FIRM now checks the
[CXI](NCCH "wikilink") exheader "kernel release version" field, when
that field is higher than the current kernel version the kernel will
return an error.
