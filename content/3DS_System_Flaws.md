Exploits are used to execute unofficial code (homebrew) on the Nintendo
3DS. This page is a list of publicly known system flaws, for userland
applications/applets flaws see [here](3DS_Userland_Flaws "wikilink").

# Stale / Rejected Efforts

- In the early days of 3DS hacking, Neimod was working on a RAM dumping
  setup for a while. He has de-soldered the 3DS's RAM chip and hooked it
  and the RAM pinouts on the 3DS's PCB up to a custom RAM dumping setup.
  He *has* published photos showing his setup to be working quite well,
  with the 3DS successfully booting up, but however, his flickr stream
  is now private along with most of his work and this method has been
  unreleased. RAM dumping can be done through homebrew now, making this
  method obsolete regardless.

## Tips and info

The 3DS uses the XN feature of the ARM11 processor. There's no official
way from applications to enable executable permission for memory
containing arbitrary unsigned code(there's a [SVC](SVC "wikilink") for
this, but only [RO-module](RO_Services "wikilink") has access to it). A
usable userland exploit would still be useful: you could only do
return-oriented-programming with it initially. From ROP one could then
exploit system flaw(s), see below.

SD card [extdata](extdata "wikilink") and SD savegames can be attacked,
for consoles where the console-unique
[movable.sed](Nand/private/movable.sed "wikilink") was dumped(accessing
SD data is far easier by running code on the target 3DS however).

<td>ARM9/ARM11 bootrom vectors point at uninitialized RAM</td>
<td>ARM9's and ARM11's exception vectors are hardcoded to point at
the CPU's internal memory (0x08000000 region for ARM9, AXIWRAM for
ARM11). While the bootrom does set them up to point to an endless loop
at some point during boot, it does not do so immediately. As such, a
carefully-timed fault injection (via hardware) to trigger an exception
(such as an invalid instruction) will cause execution to fall into ARM9
RAM. Since RAM isn't cleared on boot (see below), one can immediately
start execution of their own code here to dump bootrom, OTP, etc. The
ARM9 bootrom does the following at reset: reset vector branches to
another instruction, then branches to bootrom+0x8000. Hence, there's no
way to know for certain when exactly the ARM9 exception-vector data
stored in memory gets initialized.</p>
<p>The vulnerable timing range is about 100 CPU cycles after they start
(which happens after the PLLs have stabilized after power-up). A glitch
needs to be injected during one of these 100 cycles for the attack to
succeed.</p>

<td>The <a href="../Flash_Filesystem" title="wikilink">FIRM
partitions</a> are signed with RSA-2048 using SHA-256 and PKCS #1 v1.5
padding. Boot9, however, improperly validates the padding in three
ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot9 permits block type 02, meant for encrypted messages, to be
used for signatures. Only 01, for signatures, should have been
permitted. As a result, when using block type 02, a signature block is
not required to have a long string of FF bytes as padding, but rather
any nonzero random values suffice.</li>
<li>Boot9 does not require that the length of the padding fill out the
signature block completely. As a result, there is considerable freedom
in the layout of a signature.</li>
<li>Boot9 fails to do bounds checking in its parsing of the DER-encoded
hash algorithm type and hash value; the length values given in DER are
permitted to point outside the signature block.</li>
</ol>
<p>Flaw 3 allows the DER encoding to be such that boot9 believes that
the signature's hash value is outside the range of the block itself,
somewhere on the stack. This can be pointed at the correct hash value it
computes. Boot9 then memcmp's the calculated hash against itself, and
thinks that the hash is valid.</p>
<p>As a result of the above, we estimate that one in 2<sup>43</sup>
(~8.8 trillion) random fake signatures will be considered by Boot9 to be
valid. This is well within the range of brute force, particularly with
an optimized GPU implementation. An Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti would take about

doesn't use the region after the vector table (this is convenient
because we can put any payload we want after it and not worry about
overwriting chunks of boot9 code)</p>

4th FIRM section that causes a data-abort OR you can just overwrite the

original boot9 function pointer); you can point the rest of the vectors
to infinite loops since they shouldn't be triggered.</td>

<p>Retrieving this keydata and the <a href="../Flash_Filesystem#0x12C00"

the decrypted New3DS NAND keystore (non-unique, common to all New3DS
units), which contains AES normal keys, also set on keyslot 0x11, which

title="wikilink">9.6.0-X</a>. From there, it is trivial to perform the
same key derivation in order to initialize those keys on any system
version, and even on Old3DS.</p>
<p>This can be performed by exploiting the "arm9loaderhax" vulnerability
to obtain post-K9L code execution after an MCU reboot (the bootrom
section-loading fail is not relevant here, this attack was performed
without OTP data by brute-forcing keys), and using this to dump the
SHA_HASH register. This attack works on any FIRM version shipping a
vulnerable version of K9L, whereas OTP dumping required a boot of &lt;<a

<p>This attack results in obtaining the entire (0x200-bytes) NAND
keystore - it was confirmed at a later date that this keystore is
encrypted with the same key (by comparing the decrypted data from
multiple units), and therefore using another key in this store will not
remedy the issue as all keys are known (i.e. later, unused keys decrypt
to the same 0x200-bytes constant with the same OTP hash). Later keys
could have been encrypted differently but this is not the case. As a
result of this, it is not possible for Nintendo to use K9L again in its

yet the last message size can be an arbitrary value (the current message
pointer goes outside the file buffer and the parsing loop is broken).
This allows to overwrite a pointer to a lock object on the stack and
decrement an arbitrary value in memory. One can change the TMP file
parsing mode to have CECD trying to free all the message buffers after
parsing the next TMP file. The parsing mode is usually restored when
parsing a new TMP file, but an invalid TMP file allows to make a
function returns an error before the mode is restored , the return value
is not checked and the parser consider the file valid. The message
pointers and sizes arrays are not updated though, this is not a problem
since the previous TMP file buffer is reused for the new TMP file in
memory. Thus the message pointers actually points to controlled data.

internally.</p>
<p>A function named "UdsNode::ParseUpdateMigrationNodeInfoMessage" is
called to handle packets with cmd=5.</p>
<p>This checks the player nodeID (returns if not player 1, that is, UDS
network host), then calls an additional function which does a loop of
64-bit copies to a fixed-size stack buffer using unchecked index and
data from the received packet contents.</p>
<p>This therefore leads to trivial RCE (of every UDS network client) by
just sending a single UDS packet; only 0xC u64s on stack can be
overwritten easily, but just 2 is enough to start a ROP chain and pivot
to the rest of the UDS packet contents elsewhere on the stack.</p>
<p>To exploit some games, an attacker would need to also reimplement the
DLP server protocol (and any quirks that game has when parsing the UDS
network passphrase obtained from the DLP server). One game that requires
this is Mario Party: Island Tour (only the dlplay child connects to a
UDS network).</p>
<p>Earliest version of Pia known to be vulnerable is v2.x. v1.x still
parses this packet, but does not have the stack-copy loop (index is
still unchecked there leading to heap overflow but due to overwrites not
being contiguous in memory it may or may not be exploitable).</p>
