This page lists vulnerabilities / exploits for 3DS applications and
applets. Exploiting these initially results in ROP, from that ROP one
can then for example try exploiting
[system](3DS_System_Flaws "wikilink") flaw(s).

<td><p>UTF-16 name string buffer overflow via unchecked u8 length
field</p></td>
<td><p>The u8 at offset 0x2C in the savefile is the character-length of
the UTF-16 string at offset 0x1C. When copying this string, it's
essentially a memory-copy with lenval*2, not a string-copy. This can be
used to trigger buffer overflows at various locations depending on the
string length.</p>
<ul>
<li>When value is &gt;=0x6E it crashes when saving the saveslot, this
causes a stack-smash however it normally crashes before it returns from
the function which had the stack-frame overwritten.</li>
<li>With value &gt;=0x9A, it crashes via stack-smash in-game once any
dialogs are opened(touching buttons on the touch-screen can trigger it
too).</li>
<li>Length value&gt;=0xCD causes a crash while loading the saveslot, via
a heap buffer overflow. This buf-overflow overwrites a heap memchunk
following the allocated buffer. When the first 16-bits overwriting that
heap memchunk is not the memchunk magic-number(0x7373), the mem-alloc
code will just return a NULL ptr which later results in a crash. When
the magic-number is valid, the mem-alloc code will continue to attempt
to parse the memchunk, which may crash depending on the data which
overwrote the memchunk. This heap code is separate from the CTRSDK heap
code. Exploiting this doesn't seem to be possible: since the heap code
actually verifies that the magic-number for the next/prev memchunk ptrs
are correct(unlike CTRSDK), it's not possible to change those ptrs to
useful arbitrary addresses outside of savedata(like with triggering a
write to a c++ object ptr which later is used with a vtable func-call,
this is what one would do with CTRSDK heap here).</li>
</ul>
<p>On March 11, 2015, an exploit using this vuln was released, that one
was intended for warez/etc. The following exploit wasn't released before
then mainly because doing so would (presumably) result in the vuln being
fixed. The following old exploit was released on March 14, 2015: <a

<td><p>Heap overflow within linear memory via unchecked save file
length</p></td>
<td><p>Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon uses zlib compression for most of
its save files, possibly due to the save files being larger than its
predecessor, Gates to Infinity. When a save file is being prepared to be
loaded and read from, only a 0x32000 large buffer is allocated for file
reading, and a 0x3e800-large buffer for decompression is also allocated
before the file is read. However, the game does not limit the size of
the file read to this allocation bound, allowing for the file to
overflow into the linear memory heap and into the next allocation. Since
Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon stores allocation memchunks directly
before the allocation, overwriting the next memchunk with a corrupted
one allows for arbitrary writes of linear heap pointers when the next
buffer is allocated or arbitrary writes of any pointer within writable
memory when the corrupted buffer is freed.</p></td>

to store level save data, stats and settings. Within these XML files are
several tags containing an array of data which, when parsed, is not
properly checked to be of proper length for the tag being parsed from.
This allows for an overflow of 16-bit array values from the location
where the array is parsed. With unlock.vvv, XML data is parsed to the
stack, and with level saves the heap. This allows for the pointer where
the level save worldmap tag array should be parsed into to be
overwritten with a stack address, allowing for ROP from within the XML
array parsing function on the next level load.</p></td>

leads to an incredibly trivial stack smash. When using the autosave slot
for this, the save is parsed when the user selects "continue". When
using one of the dedicated save slots (1-3), the save is parsed shortly
after the company splash screens fade. Note that the save is read quite
high (descending) on the stack - when exploiting this, one would likely
need to move SP due to almost instantly overflowing the physical

CTPK code <em>if</em> one could get custom SpotPass data into extdata
somehow(ctr-httpwn &gt;=v1.2 with bosshaxx allows this).</p>
<p>The code for this runs from a thread separate from the main-thread,
with the stack in linearmem heap. This SpotPass handling triggers before
the game ever opens the regular savedata archive. The extdata is opened
at some point before this: it opens a file for checking if it exists,
then immediately closes it.</p>

| KFH frame count overflow   | The KFH frame count field should not be \>= 0x3E8, but it wasn't checked and so uncontrolled data were written over pointers, causing an unexploitable crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | System: 11.6                | September 20, 2017                               | [MrNbaYoh](User:Nba_Yoh "wikilink") |
| KMI paper color overflow   | Paper color field (and similar color fields) in KMI chunks was not checked, a too high value caused a jump to an uncontrolled location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | System: 11.6                | September 20, 2017                               | [MrNbaYoh](User:Nba_Yoh "wikilink") |
| KSN BGM data size overflow | The size of the BGM data in the KSN chunk was not checked, it was used in a memcpy so with a big enough size one could overwrite a thread stack on linear mem and achieve ROP (notehax v1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | System: 11.6                | September 20, 2017                               | [MrNbaYoh](User:Nba_Yoh "wikilink") |
| KMC chunk unchecked        | The KMC chunk was not verified at all, the CRC32 and the size were not checked. A big enough size caused an integer overflow and made the game read the file backward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | System: 11.6                | September 20, 2017                               | [MrNbaYoh](User:Nba_Yoh "wikilink") |
| KMI layer size unchecked   | The 3 layer size fields in KMI chunks were not checked, leading to some crashes in the editor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | System: 11.6                | September 20, 2017                               | [MrNbaYoh](User:Nba_Yoh "wikilink") |
| Bad "queue" implementation | When a KWZ was parsed, frames were copied in a kind of queue, bounds were not checked obviously, so with the KMI layer size flaw one was able to fill completely the queue, then write past the buffer and overwrite a heap chunk header (notehax v2). This is not possible anymore, the queue cannot be filled because layer sizes are checked. Moreover each time an element is removed from the queue, the whole content is memmoved \*facepalm\*. | System: 11.6                | September 20, 2017                               | [MrNbaYoh](User:Nba_Yoh "wikilink") |

## Useless crashes / applications which were fuzzed

- Pushmo (3DSWare), QR codes: level name is properly limited to 16
  characters, game doesn't crash with a longer name. The only possible
  crashes are triggered by out-of-bounds array index values, these
  crashes are not exploitable due to the index value being 8bit.

<!-- -->

- [Pyramids (3DSWare)](Pyramids_(3DSWare) "wikilink"), QR codes: no
  strings. Only crashes are from out-of-bounds values (like background
  ID) and are not exploitable.

<!-- -->

- [Pyramids 2 (3DSWare)](Pyramids_2_(3DSWare) "wikilink"), QR codes: no
  strings. Only crashes are from out-of-bounds values (like background
  ID) and are not exploitable.

<!-- -->

- [The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
  3D](https://github.com/yellows8/mm3d_re)

<!-- -->

- "The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds" and "The Legend of Zelda:
  Tri Force Heroes": these games don't crash at all when the entire
  save-file(minus constant header data) is overwritten with /dev/random
  output / 0xFF-bytes. All of the CRC32s were updated for this of
  course. Note that this refers to the regular save file: Tri Force
  Heroes can be exploited via BOSS extdata - see above.

<!-- -->

- Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity has the same unchecked file
  bounds as Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, however since save
  compression was introduced in Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon, it only
  allocates one buffer within the application heap instead of several
  within the linear heap, resulting in nothing to corrupt or overwrite
  even if the file's length is extended past its allocation.

<!-- -->

- "Kid Icarus: Uprising": Overwriting the entire savedata results in
  various crashes, nothing useful.

<!-- -->

- Savedata/extdata for "Super Smash Bros 3DS": Overwriting the various
  files stored under savedata/extdata results in useless crashes.

<!-- -->

- "StarFox 64 3D": Doesn't crash at all with the entire savedata
  overwritten.

<!-- -->

- "Frogger 3D": Overwriting a savefile with random-data results in
  \*nothing\* crashing.

<!-- -->

- "Mutant Mudds": Overwriting the savefile with random data results in a
  crash

<!-- -->

- "Worcle Worlds": Overwriting the savefile with 0xFF results in a crash
  due to an out of bound read

<!-- -->

- "Animal Crossing: New Leaf": Creating a QR code from random data
  results in a valid QR code and a random design. In some very rare
  cases(which aren't always reproducible?) a crash/etc may occur, but
  this isn't known to be useful.

<!-- -->

- "Angry Birds Star Wars": Strings in the savefile are preceded by their
  lengths. These strings are never stored on the stack and are memcpy'd
  into heap memory. If the size is invalid the alloc will fail and thus
  the memcpy will operate on a nullptr resulting in a useless data
  abort.

<!-- -->

- "Gem Smashers": Overwriting the savefile with random bytes results in
  useless crashes.

<!-- -->

- "Luxor:" Strings/plaintext in the savefile are present and these's no
  checks. Overwriting the whole save (excluding the header), with
  /dev/random cause a useless crash.

<!-- -->

- "Luv Me Buddies Wonderland:" Doesn't crash at all with the entire
  savedata overwritten. Overwriting some areas, points to useless nulls

## Crashes needing investigation

- Disney Infinity crashes when all savedata overwritten with
  /dev/urandom. No checksums. 0xFF bytes don't cause a crash.

<!-- -->

- Football Up Online / Soccer Up Online and Football Up 3D / Soccer Up
  3D crash when teamname(UTF-16) length = 0x48 AND 0x20 null bytes are
  removed after just the name or if teamname length is way longer than
  0x48.

copies those titleIDs to another buffer, where the offset relative to
that buffer is calculated using the corresponding s8/s16 entries. Those
two values are not range checked at all. Hence, one can use this to
write u64(s) with arbitrary values to before/after this allocated output
buffer. See <a href="Home_Menu" title="wikilink">here</a> regarding
Launcher.dat structure.</p>
<p>This can be exploited(with Launcher.dat loading at startup at least)
by using a s16 for the icon entry with value 0xFFEC(-20)(and perhaps
more icons with similar s16 values to write multiple u64s). The result
is that the u64 value is written to outbuf-0xA0, which overwrites
object+0(vtable) and object+4(doesn't matter here) for an object that
gets used a bit after the vulnerable function triggers. The low 32bits
of the u64 can then be set to the address of controlled memory(either
outbuf in regular heap or the entire launcherdat buffer in linearmem),
for use as a fake vtable in order to get control of PC. From there one
can begin ROP via vtable funcptrs to do a stack-pivot(r4=objectaddr at
the time the above object gets used).</p>
<p>Originally this vuln could only be triggered via Launcher.dat at Home
Menu startup, right after Launcher.dat gets loaded + memory gets
allocated, once the file-format version code is finished running.
Starting with v9.6 this can be triggered when loading layouts from SD
extdata as well. The vuln itself triggers before the layout data is
written to Launcher.dat, but it doesn't seem to be possible to overwrite
anything which actually gets used before the function which writes
Launcher.dat into the layout gets called.</p>
<p>Home Menu has some sort of fail-safe system(or at least on v9.7) when
Home Menu crashes due to Launcher.dat(this also applies for other things
with Home Menu): after crashing once, Home Menu resets Launcher.dat to a
state where it no longer crashes anymore. However, note that any
exploits using this which hang/etc without crashing will still brick the
system. <strong>Hence, attempting anything with this on physnand without
hw-nand-access isn't really recommended.</strong></p></td>

title="wikilink">themehax</a>)</p></td>
<td><p>The only func-call size parameter used by the theme decompression
function is one for the compressed size, none for the decompressed size.
The decompressed-size value from the LZ header is used by this function
to check when to stop decompressing, but this function itself has
nothing to verify the decompressed_size with. The code calling this
function does not check or even use the decompressed size from the
header either.</p>
<p>This function is separate from the rest of the Home Menu code: the
function used for decompressing themes is *only* used for decompressing
themes, nothing else. There's a separate decompression function in Home
Menu used for decompressing everything else.</p>
<p>That other decompression function in Home Menu handles decompression
size properly(decompressed size check for max buffer size is done by
code calling the other function, not in the function itself). Unlike the
other function, the theme function supports multiple LZ algorithms, but
the one which actually gets used in official themes is the same one
supported by the other function anyway.</p>
<p>See also <a href="menuhax" title="wikilink">here</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="10.2.0-28" title="wikilink">10.2.0-X</a> Home Menu, the
only code change was that the following was added right after theme-load
and before actual decompression:
"if(<get_lzheader_decompressed_size>(compressed_buf) &gt;
0x150000)<exit>;". This fixed the vuln.</p></td>

<td><p>The extdata file-reading code allocates a fixed-size heap buffer
for the expected filesize, then reads the filedata into this buffer
using the actual FS filesize. Before v5.0 the filesize used here wasn't
validated, hence if the filesize is larger than alloc_size a buffer
overflow would occur. <em>After</em> doing the file-read it does
validate that the actual_readsize matches the alloc_size, but at this
point the buffer overflow has already occurred.</p>
<p>This affected at least the following: SaveData.dat and Cache.dat.</p>
<p>This can be triggered with SaveData.dat by installing a &lt;v4.0 Home
Menu version, with Home Menu extdata from &gt;=v4.0 still on SD. When
this is done with v2.0 Home Menu, a kernelpanic occurs when processing
an AM command(it appears a buffer ptr which is then passed to a command
was overwritten with 0x0 - of course other SaveData.dat filesizes may
result in different behaviour).</p></td>

The icon data arrays used with {sd/nand}iconhax were added to
SaveData.dat/Launcher.dat with [4.0.0-X](4.0.0-7 "wikilink"), hence the
vulnerable functions were added with that same version.

With \<=v4.0 the SaveData.dat buffer is located in the regular heap.
It's unknown when exactly it was moved to linearmem, which is where it's
located with recent versions. It's located in linearmem for KOR \>=v9.6
for example.

The SaveData.dat/Launcher.dat icon vulns were fixed by doing various
unsigned \>=60/\>=360 checks on the loaded values. When these checks
fail, it just skips over handling this icon entry. Hence, the original
value can't be negative / out-of-bounds any more.

## Useless crashes

Old3DS system web-browser:

- 2^32 characters long string(*finally* fixed with v10.6): this is
  similar to the vulnerability fixed
  [here](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=external/Webkit.git;a=commitdiff;h=ec471f16fbd1f879cb631f9b022fd16acd75f4d4),
  concat-large-strings-crash2.html triggers a crash which is about the
  same as the one triggered by a 2^32 string. Most of the time this
  vulnerability will cause a memory page permissions fault, since the
  WebKit code attempts to copy the string text data to the output buffer
  located in read-only [CRO](CRO0 "wikilink") heap memory. The only
  difference between a crash triggered by a 2^32 string and the
  concat-large-strings-crash2.html crash is at the former copies the
  string data using the original string length(like 1 text character for
  "x", 4 for "xxxx") while the latter attempts to copy \>12MB. In some
  *very* rare cases a thread separate from the string data-copy thread
  will crash, this might be exploitable. However, this is mostly useless
  since it rarely crashes this way.

<!-- -->

- Trying to directly load a page via the browser "URL" option with
  [webkitdebug](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_browserhax_common)
  setup, causes a crash to trigger in oss.cro due to an use-after-free
  being caught with webkitdebug. This is presumably some sort of
  realloc() issue in the libcurl version used by the \<={v10.2-v10.3}
  browser. This happens with \*every\* \*single\* \*page\* one tries to
  load via the "URL" option, but not when loading links on the current
  page, hence this is probably useless. A different use-after-free with
  realloc triggers with loading any page at all regardless of method
  too(libcurl probably).

- This WebKit build has *a lot* of crash-trigger bugs that only happen
  with [webkitdebug](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_browserhax_common)
  completely setup(addr accesses near 0x0), with *just* trying to load
  any page at all.
