## Theme

How about we change the default theme to 'Vector' to match the Wii and
WiiU brew sites? --[Elisherer](User:Elisherer "wikilink") 08:51, 11

## Translations

To whoever translates this days..

- I recommend you wouldn't waste your time on translating pages which
  aren't finished (i.e. [Savegames](Savegames "wikilink"))
- Do not translate database pages like [Title
  list](Title_list "wikilink") or [Friend code](Friend_code "wikilink")
  these pages are updated regulary.
- This Wiki doesn't have a localization plug-in I would recommend
  waiting until it does..

Humm...

I think we create the other domains for those
languages.--Matyapiro3118:24, 19 March 2012 (CET)

## Forum?

A forum will be created when it becomes necessary, for e.g. actual
discussion about homebrew development. Currently homebrew is not
possible, so a forum is not needed yet.

Now a forum exists. Check out [4dsdev.org](http://www.4dsdev.org)!

## weird communication

Hello all, I found some weird UDP communication coming from the 3ds to
the internet (japan). Connection is made towards IP 203.180.85.77,
202.232.239.25, and contains a string. String starts with afa1, then the
number 1,4 or 6, then comes either a short or long string (can contain
00) and it ends with a 2-byte counter (b3 in my case). It seems to be
repeated, but I cant reproduce it as of now. It happened after I tried
to update the 3ds, but it could be related to video/spotpass
(suggestions?)

Example: af a1 44 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 b3

Any suggestions/ideas what it could be? --[Mr

## Homebrew install idea?

Could it be installed in a way similar to Smash Bros. Brawl? Where you
go to a webpage with a 3D image to download (like on 3ds.to) but when
you load it in Camera/Swapnote it triggers? Or with the new Save Backup
feature they just added? Sorry if this is the wrong place to suggest
ideas... [Jarieスイクン](User:Jariesuicune "wikilink") 18:22, 28 June

It is good place to post idea, that's all good as well. however since
there is few that can reverse those ARM executables, we don't have ones
alike yellow that can do such a job. even grabbed the power of 4.5.x we
don't have people that can work on analysis on those app - we don't have
enough ones to see into the implementation of system modules yet. So
that is a pity we can only think and suggest, or go to learn reverse
engineering and ARM disassembly first. BTW that site seems down (to me),
also i don't think they would enable such a method. you can contact them
on irc when you got something you think that is very interesting or
would easily happen.--[Syphurith](User:Syphurith "wikilink") 05:31, 29

It has signature checks. ARM9 has them and I have a dump of ARM9 memory,
but I'm too lazy to disassemble it. Can anyone do
that?--[173210](User:173210 "wikilink") 00:43, 1 November 2014 (CET)

## DSiBrew

Can one of the devs on DSIBREW lock the crucial pages. I (Dsihaxx) have
been going around correcting them with the latest backups on the wayback
machine however random people keep changing it to either advertisements
or gibberish. Thx.
