## Are tools involving ROMs allowed?

Are pages about Gateway3DS and similar tools allowed on this wiki? I
didn’t see anything in the copyright notice about these tools, and I
didn’t see a notice on the Gateway3DS page saying it was previously
deleted. [Hallowizer](User:Hallowizer "wikilink")

I guess not, since Gateway3DS was deleted.

There was a page about it that was [once
deleted](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Special:Log?page=Gateway_3DS) due
to its purpose only being for piracy, so no.
