change-log:

- Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor
  adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience.

## System Titles

[CVer](CVer "wikilink") and the HTTP system-module were updated. The
[NCCH](NCCH "wikilink") encryption used for both of these titles was not
changed.

The HTTP-module update appears to be just a rebuild for the latest FIRM
revision(from [8.0.0-18](8.0.0-18 "wikilink")). The previous version had
"\[SDK+NINTENDO:Firmware-02_44_05\]" in the NCCH plain region(old
pre-release revision), the current version had that updated to
"\*_06\]"(which matches the current FIRM revision). Note that there's
other system-modules which were updated with
[8.0.0-18](8.0.0-18 "wikilink"), which were built for FIRM revision \<6.
