"1").

The Old3DS [Internet Browser](Internet_Browser "wikilink") was updated,
see here for [details](Internet_Browser "wikilink"). The WebKit build
used for the browser was updated which fixed a public Old3DS browser
exploit, however this WebKit build is still old since other newer
vuln(s) from the same year as that one are still not fixed.
