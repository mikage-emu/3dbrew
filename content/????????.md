This appears in the play log when Nintendo wants to
[hide](SMDH "wikilink") usage of an application. This is seen when some
[Developer Applications](3DS_Development_Unit_Software "wikilink") are
run as well as when [Nintendo Service Center
Tools](Nintendo_Service_Center_Tools "wikilink") are run. When an
application's usage is hidden like this, it also affects the 'Friends
List' app. When using a 'masked' application the Friends List will not
show it in the list of applications to pick as "Favourite Title", nor
will it show up on the 3DS's friend card if the user is using the
application (The user appears to be running no application).

This "icon" is used whenever there's a title in the playlog where the
title isn't found in the icon [cache](Home_Menu "wikilink")(as mentioned
[here](SMDH "wikilink")), which can be caused by the title not being
launched by Home Menu. For example, the Download Play application will
be listed like this when it was only ever run by \*hax payload without
launching from Home Menu. The SMDH icon flag for this appears to only
affect icon cache storage, [PTM](PTM_Services "wikilink") playlog is
unaffected.
