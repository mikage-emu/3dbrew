The activity log is a stock application that comes with retail units.
The application allows you to review various statistics about the step
counter and your gaming habits.

The opening screen shows the total number of steps recorded as well as
the total number of titles used.

The application is split into two sections, the daily records and the
software library.

__TOC__

## Daily Records

The daily records have two submodes, graph view and list view.

### Graph view

The daily records shows on a per hour basis how many steps you took and
how much you played. You can group the data into larger time units, but
the underlaying data is tracked per hour.

You can also see the most popular title for the given time period.

### List view

The list view is mainly about play times. It lists each title that you
have played during the time period and how long in total.

## Software Library

The software library tracks all the applications that you have used on
the system. It has an upper limit of 112 applications.

The list shows the total time you have used an application, the number
of times that you have launched it, when it was first launched and when
it was last launched. It also calculates the mean usage time.

### Charts

The charts submode allows you to sort the data using any of the
previously mentioned statistics.

## Title name "????????"

This appears in the play log when Nintendo wants to
[hide](SMDH "wikilink") usage of an application. This is seen when some
[Developer Applications](3DS_Development_Unit_Software "wikilink") are
run as well as when [Nintendo Service Center
Tools](Nintendo_Service_Center_Tools "wikilink") are run. When an
application's usage is hidden like this, it also affects the 'Friends
List' app. When using a 'masked' application the Friends List will not
show it in the list of applications to pick as "Favourite Title", nor
will it show up on the 3DS's friend card if the user is using the
application (The user appears to be running no application).

This "icon" is used whenever there's a title in the playlog where the
title isn't found in the icon [cache](Home_Menu "wikilink")(as mentioned
[here](SMDH "wikilink")), which can be caused by the title not being
launched by Home Menu. For example, the Download Play application will
be listed like this when it was only ever run by \*hax payload without
launching from Home Menu. The SMDH icon flag for this appears to only
affect icon cache storage, [PTM](PTM_Services "wikilink") playlog is
unaffected.
