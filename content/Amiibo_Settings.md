Amiibo Settings is a built-in (stock) app that is hidden from the Home
Menu. You can access it through Home Menu Quick Settings (the
House/Wrench icon in the top left corner of the Home Menu). It is used
to edit and reset Amiibo save data, as well as updating the 3DS NFC
Reader/Writer (if on an old 3DS/old 2DS).
