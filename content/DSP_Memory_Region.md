*Note that everything below may vary depending on the exact DSP firmware
used and different variants have slightly different behaviours.*

The DSP communicates with the application through two shared memory
areas 0x8000 bytes long each (at 0x1FF50000 and 0x1FF70000
respectively). The DSP alternates between the use of these two areas
(much like a double-buffer). Each area has 15 structures within it. The
location of these structures can be obtained by [reading channel 2 of
the DSP pipe](DSP:ReadPipe "wikilink"). A list of structures in the
order the DSP addresses are read from the pipe follows:

1\. Frame count

2\. Input configurations

3\. Input status

4\. Input ADPCM coefficients

5\. DSP configuration

6\. DSP status

7\. Output samples

8\. Intermediate mix samples

9\. Compressor table

10\. DSP debug statistics

11\. Unknown Coefficients

12\. Unknown Coefficients

13\. Unknown Coefficients

14\. Surround sound biquad filter 1

15\. Surround sound biquad filter 2

The DSP has 24 inputs, each of which are individually configurable.
These 24 inputs each produce three sets of 4 audio channels (two left,
two right).

These four audio channels feed into three intermediate mixers. Two of
these intermediate mixers are used for effects and aux.

## Frame Count

The frame count of the first region must be even and the frame count of
the second region must be odd.

The frame with the higher count is the "current region".

The DSP firmware only responds if the first frame count is 4.

## Input Config

A 192 byte long structure. There are 24 of them.

interpolation step.

## DSP configuration

### Delay Effect

Delay with feedback.

Length of delay is expressed in terms of number of audio frames (there
are 160 samples per audio frame).

Feedback arm only has a gain on it. Under the feedback arm is a
single-pole filter with the delay.

### Reverb Effect

Reverb consists of two comb filters and one all-pass filter in standard
configuration.
