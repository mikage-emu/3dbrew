**DSaveManager** can be used to transfer savefiles from DS/3DS games via
wlan to a PC.

Thanks to [Erant](User:Erant "wikilink") for the FLASH code!

## Change log v0.2

- Improved UI
- added restore from FAT
- added better savefile size detection for 3DS FLASH

## Usage

- Read the ReadMe!!
- Setup WFC via a game
- Change the IP in the dsm.ini to that of the PC running the DSM.exe
  (Leave a newline at the end of the IP)
- Load the DSM.nds on your DS/DSLite, any method should work fine.
- Follow the onscreen instructions!

# Caution!

Restoring saves is not working for some 3DS games. Always dump the
restored savegame again and verify that it matches.
