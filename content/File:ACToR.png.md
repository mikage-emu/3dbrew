Showing off BCSAR reading/extraction program, ACToR (Audio CTR). The
program itself isn't released but I thought I'd show it off a little
since I've been adding a lot of information to the BCSAR page here. I
can still think of quite a few more things I could do with it, so it's a
beta yet.

In case you're curious as to why the partition names are coloured, it's
a validity check. (green = valid, red = invalid)
