I've decided to be nice and give you guys a little glimpse of the
upcoming CiTRUS version I call "CiTRUS Ultimate".

Currently I am polishing this tool in preparation for the upcoming
release. The enabled buttons are indeed fully functional. I am hoping to
release CiTRUS Ultimate (rev 1) during the upcoming GBATemp homebrew
bounty. All will be revealed soon.

Stay tuned!
