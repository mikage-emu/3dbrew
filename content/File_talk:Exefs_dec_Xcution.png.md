How did you get decrypted content? The 3DS keys haven't been dumped yet,
and the encryption layer is atleast as complex as the DSi's. Or is that
some kind of debug CXI that was encrypted with a simpler, insecure key?

hehe, Xcution has the SDK... btw is it legal to share the
key?--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 19:15, 23 February

Sharing keys is a legal gray area if I'm not mistaken (this would
probably be more on the illegal side though). But this is most likely a
debug app, so it wouldn't be encrypted with the retail key, so no poking
around retail code yet. At least that's how I understand it. Pretty neat
though! :) --[CHR15x94](User:CHR15x94 "wikilink") 21:26, 23 February

You could always make a program that generates a key form a number (like
the meaning of life
