showed the following information

### Friend cards

The first time setup generates a personal friend card. This card
displays the Personal Mii, favorite software and friend code. If the
software in use supports them, friend cards can include additional
features, such as status comments, the presence feature, and the join-in
feature.

The presence feature notifies your friends when you are online with your
oline status, last time online, game currently playing. Online status is
shown using the Mii on the friend card or with the text "Online". When a
friend is offline, the last time they were online is displayed. If they
stay online for more than 10 days,, the text disappears.

When a user is playing a game, the join-in feature notifies the userâ€™s
friends that they can play the application with the user, and enables
those friends to join in gameplay.
