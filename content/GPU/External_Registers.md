This page describes the address range accessible from the ARM11, used to
configure the basic GPU functionality. For information about the
internal registers used for 3D rendering, see [GPU/Internal
Registers](GPU/Internal_Registers "wikilink").

## Map

Address mappings for the external registers. GSPGPU:WriteHWRegs takes
these addresses relative to 0x1EB00000.

Memory fills are used to initialize buffers in memory with a given
value, similar to memset. A memory fill is triggered by setting bit0 in
the control register. Doing so aborts any running memory fills on that
filling unit. Upon completion, the hardware unsets bit0 and sets bit1
and fires interrupt PSC0.

These registers are used by [GX
SetMemoryFill](GSP_Shared_Memory#GX_SetMemoryFill "wikilink").

## LCD Source Framebuffer Setup

All of these registers must be accessed with 32bit operations regardless
of the registers' actual bit size.

The naming of these parameters reflects the physical characteristics of
the displays, and not the way the 3DS is normally held.

To make sense of these values, the 3DS must be held in a way, so that
the bottom screen is in the left hand, and the top screen is in the
right hand, and that way the first pixel will be in the top-left corner,
as it should be. If the 3DS is held normally, the first pixel is in the
bottom-left corner.

All pixel and scanline timing values are 12bits, unless noted. This also
applies to those fields where two u16 are combined into one register.
Each u16 field is only 12bits in size. timin

The horizontal timing parameter order is as follows (values may overflow
through HTotal register value):

```
0x10 < 0x14 <= 0x60.LO <= 0x04 <= 0x60.HI <= 0x08 <= 0x0C <= 0x10
0x18 <= 0x60.LO
```

Timing starts from HCount == 0, then each absolute value in the
beforementioned register chain triggers when HCount == register,
latching the primitive display controller into a new mode. There is an
inherent latch order, where if two simultenaous events occur, one event
wins over another.

```
Known latched modes (in order):
- HSync (triggers a line to the LCD to move to the next line)
- Back porch (area between HSync and border being displayed, no pixels pushed, min 16 pixel clocks, otherwise the screen gets glitchy)
- Left border start (no image data is being displayed, just a configurable solid color)
- Image start (pixel data is being DMA'd from video memory or main RAM)
- Right border start/Image end (border color is being displayed after the main image)
- Unknown synchronization (supposed to be probably right border end, but this mode seems to be broken or not do anything)
- Front porch (no pixels pushed, 68 clock min, otherwise the screen doesn't sync properly, and really glitches out)

- The weird thing about scan doubling, is that it works different
  between the bottom and top LCD. On the bottom LCD, it doubles the
  number of outputted pixels (so the same pixel is outputted twice,
  effectively doing column doubling). However on the top screen, it does
  scanline doubling instead. Considering that the bottom screen's table
  doesn't work on the top screen, this could give a hint as to how the
  top screen receives the pixel data from the PDC.

On a 2DS, it seems to have no effect on the top part of the display, and
on the bottom screen it just shifts the framebuffer to the right two
pixels.

GSP module only allows the LCD stereoscopy to be enabled when bit5=1 and
bit6=0 here. When GSP module updates this register, GSP module will
automatically disable the stereoscopy if those bits are not set for
enabling stereoscopy.

When both interlacing and scan doubling are disabled, the full
resolution of the top screen (240x800) can be utilized if the PDC
registers are updated to accomodate this higher resolution. GSP contains
tables for this mode (gsp mode == 1). GSP automatically applies this
mode if both bit5 and bit6 are cleared. This is also the default, and
the only valid mode for the bottom screen in userland.

If only AB interlacing is enabled, gsp detects this as a request to
switch to 3D mode (gsp mode == 2), and enables the parallax barrier.
It's unknown how to control this, but some other PDC registers control
if interlacing should be done by true interleaving (both framebuffers
are treated as 240x400), or skipping lines (both framebuffers are
treated as 240x800)

If only scan doubling is enabled, gsp detects it as a request to switch
back to 2D mode for the top screen (gsp mode == 0). This is also the
default mode for the top screen.

Both interlacing and scan doubling can't be enabled in usermode, but it
works as expected in baremetal.

### Framebuffer color formats

| Value | Description    |
|-------|----------------|
| 0     | GL_RGBA8_OES   |
| 1     | GL_RGB8_OES    |
| 2     | GL_RGB565_OES  |
| 3     | GL_RGB5_A1_OES |
| 4     | GL_RGBA4_OES   |

Color components are laid out in reverse byte order, with the most
significant bits used first (i.e. non-24-bit pixels are stored as a
little-endian values). For instance, a raw data stream of two
GL_RGB565_OES pixels looks like GGGBBBBB RRRRRGGG GGGBBBBB RRRRRGGG.

Color formats 5, 6, and 7 are blocked by gsp, but they behave as
pixel-doubled RGBA8 (not line doubling, but instead the same pixel is
output twice) if used outside of userland.

These registers are used by [GX command](GSP_Shared_Memory "wikilink") 3
and 4. For cmd4, \*0x1EF00C18 \|= 1 is used instead of just writing
value 1. The DisplayTransfer registers are only used if bit 3 of the
flags is unset and ignored otherwise. The TextureCopy registers are
likewise only used if bit 3 is set, and ignored otherwise.

### TextureCopy

When bit 3 of the control register is set, the hardware performs a
TextureCopy-mode transfer. In this mode, all other bits of the control
register (except for bit 2, which still needs to be set correctly) and
the regular dimension registers are ignored, and no format conversions
are done. Instead, it performs a raw data copy from the source to the
destination, but with a configurable gap between lines. The total amount
of bytes to copy is specified in the size register, and the hardware
loops reading lines from the input and writing them to the output until
this amount is copied. The "gap" specified in the input/output dimension
register is the number of chunks to skip after each "width" chunks of
the input/output, and is NOT counted towards the total size of the
transfer.

By correctly calculating the input and output gap sizes it is possible
to use this functionality to copy arbitrary sub-rectangles between
differently-sized framebuffers or textures, which is one of its main
uses over a regular no-conversion DisplayTransfer. When copying tiled
textures/framebuffers it's important to remember that the contents of a
tile are laid out sequentially in memory, and so this should be taken
into account when calculating the transfer parameters.

Specifying invalid/junk values for the TextureCopy dimensions can result
in the GPU hanging while attempting to process this TextureCopy.

These 3 registers are used by [GX
command](GSP_Shared_Memory "wikilink") 1. This is used for [GPU
commands](GPU/Internal_Registers "wikilink").

## Framebuffers

These LCD framebuffers normally contain the last rendered frames from
the GPU. The framebuffers are drawn from left-to-right, instead of
top-to-bottom.(Thus the beginning of the framebuffer is drawn starting
at the left side of the screen)

Both of the 3D screen left/right framebuffers are displayed regardless
of the 3D slider's state, however when the 3D slider is set to "off" the
3D effect is disabled. Normally when the 3D slider's state is set to
"off" the left/right framebuffer addresses are set to the same physical
address. When the 3D effect is disabled and the left/right framebuffers
are set to separate addresses, the LCD seems to alternate between
displaying the left/right framebuffer each frame.
