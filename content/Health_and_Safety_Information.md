Health and Safety Information is a built-in (stock) app that comes
pre-installed on all 3DSs. It is intended to warn the user about some
health risks when using the device, such as seizures. The app is split
into two sections: "Important Info" (which attempts to discourage the
user from installing CFW), and "Health and Safety" (which tells about
the health risks of using the device and 3D). You can inject any
homebrew app (like FBI) into Health and Safety Information, as long as
the app is not bigger than the original Health and Safety app. You
inject homebrew into H&S (short for Health and Safety) using GodMode9.
