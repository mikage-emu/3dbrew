This page deals with a several of questions you may counter.

## Editing page

- Q: WTF! I edited with care, and publish ending with a '503' or
  'Connection Reset'! Can i restore the content?

:\* A: Sorry. What i can suggest you is **Copy all your content to paste
somewhere as Notepad before "Save Page"**. Or you can have some
extensions installed on your browser which may help you log those
content in the textbox.

- Q:I don't know how to write in Wiki grammar..

:\* A: Well~ Open a page contains the type of statements you would like
to use, use edit and check its source, then write yourself. **Preview
helps you**. Also please not 'Save' just on the page you checked as the
reference of grammar - except that is exactly what you want to edit.
