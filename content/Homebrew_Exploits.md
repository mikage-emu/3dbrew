a 3DSX launcher. They cannot launch any homebrew in the 3DSX format, but
could still prove useful by chaining to exploits with higher privileges.

As of October 15, 2015, this is no longer usable due to an update being released which fixes the vuln used by tubehax + app update being forced (see [here](YouTube "wikilink")). | smea   | [Install](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/) |

## Other Homebrew Loaders

The [hblauncher_loader](https://github.com/yellows8/hblauncher_loader)
title can be used when running under modded-FIRM which allows running
unsigned titles, to boot the \*hax payloads.

[Luma3DS](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS), apart from providing
signature patches for the installation and use of custom titles,
includes the "Rosalina" system module, which among its features allows
cleanly loading 3dsx applications as a native process with full ARM11
system permissions, by replacing an installed title's ExeFS and ExHeader
during load time. It is currently the only option for running 3dsx
applications on 11.4+ O3DSes; additionally, the \*hax 2.x payload is
incompatible with Rosalina and therefore so are homebrew applications
requiring its target title system.

## Sysmodule Exploits

This section is for system-module exploits, which can be run from the
\*hax payloads.
