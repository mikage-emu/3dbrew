title = 'Internet Browser'
+++

The 3DS Internet Browser was added in the June 2011 Update for
JPN/EUR/USA.

From the Internet Browser help section: In compliance with the LGPL, the
source code of the OSS is available via the Nintendo website. This
source code can be downloaded here:
[1](http://mediacontent.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/images/service/OpenSources.zip)
[2](http://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/oss/index.html)

The 3DS Internet Browser is
[Netfront](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfront) Browser NX v1.0 based
on [WebKit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) engine.

On O3DS the exheader name of this title is "SPIDER"; on N3DS, "SKATER".
The only difference between the ExeFS .code for each region of the
Old3DS/New3DS browser, is byte values for the title uniqueID/region.

A ["dummy" browser](#dummy_web-browser "wikilink") (which replaces the
actual browser) is being included with cartdrige games shipping with
system updates starting with [9.9.0-X](9.9.0-26 "wikilink"). In
addition, versions of the real browser since 9.9.0-26X attempt to
[check-in with a Nintendo server](#forced_system-update "wikilink") to
determine if the existing browser version is out of date.

## [New 3DS](New_3DS "wikilink") Internet Browser

New3DS has a separate browser title, with the exheader name "SKATER".
Unlike the Old3DS browser, the New3DS browser has videos+HTML5 support.

This browser also has a filter enabled by default in the JPN version.
Disabling it requires paying money with a credit-card, for
[purchasing](NIM_Services "wikilink") web-browser
[DLC](Title_list/DLC "wikilink"). During startup the browser does
various HTTPS comms. When visting an URL, the browser sends a plaintext
HTTP POST here: [3](http://ars.ifuser.jp:20080/ars2/rating). The raw
POST data begins with "ARS/2.0\r\n\x00", the rest appears to be
encrypted. The server reply content also has this ARS header + encrypted
data. This appears to use a fixed xorpad, likely from a fixed encryption
CTR/IV. The server content responses for allowed sites, and blocked
sites, are fixed. When the server returns that the site is blocked, the
browser goes to this page: [4](http://ars.ifuser.jp/filter/44.html)(the
Referrer header value is set to the same URL it's actually requesting).

The WebKit source was updated since the Old3DS browser. The New3DS
browser uses the following services: [mvd:STD](MVD_Services "wikilink")
and [ir:rst](IR_Services "wikilink")(DLC-related services are used too
but those aren't New3DS specific). Video decoding is done with
[mvd:STD](MVD_Services "wikilink"). Audio decoding/playback is done with
a browser-specific DSP binary. The Old3DS browser used CSND for audio
playback, the New3DS browser doesn't have access to that at all since it
uses DSP instead.

### Video / libstagefright

The browser manual includes licenses for Android and PacketVideo. The
browser uses libstagefright from Android. Just like WebKit, the browser
appears to use a very old version of libstagefright with security/other
changes back-ported(for example, the v10.7 browser libstagefright
codebase seems to be older than
[this](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/ec77122351b4e78c1fe5b60a208f76baf8c67591%5E%21/media/libstagefright/MPEG4Extractor.cpp)).
This codebase is missing certain chunk-parsing code for 3GP.

HTTP for libstagefright is internally handled with
[HTTPC](HTTP_Services "wikilink"), with a similar(?) set of RootCAs as
for browser-version-check.

### User-Agent and Browser Versions

Normal user-agent format:
`Mozilla/5.0 (New Nintendo 3DS like iPhone) AppleWebKit/`<WebKit version>` (KHTML, like Gecko) NX/`<Netfront version>` Mobile NintendoBrowser/`<Mobile NintendoBrowser version>`.`<region>

`<region>` can be one of the following: "JP", "US", or "EU".

Mobile User-Agent is always
`Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/536.26 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0 Mobile/10A403 Safari/8536.25`.

Note that the latest Old3DS browser WebKit version at the time the
initial New3DS browser was released, was the following: 532.8.

The first version of the KOR New3DS browser was v9.6(which was when the
New3DS KOR titles were originally added). Each version of the KOR
browser has the same NintendoBrowser version as the other regions. The
KOR browser has been only updated when the browser for the other regions
were updated, hence the title-versions are the same as well. The KOR
browser ExeFS .code is different from the other regions(more than just
region-related IDs etc).

#### OSS 9.0 and 9.3 diff

The following is a diff of the OSS archives from
[here](http://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/oss/index.html), for v9.0 and
v9.3.

```
FilesÂ NewNintendo3DS_OpenSources9.0.0-/WKC/WebCore/platform/network/WKC/ResourceHandleManagerWKC.cppÂ andÂ NewNintendo3DS_OpenSources9.3.0-/WKC/WebCore/platform/network/WKC/ResourceHandleManagerWKC.cppÂ differ

```

WKC_CUSTOMER_RELEASE_VERSION was changed from "0.5.8" to "0.5.10".

The following code was added to ResourceHandleManager::doRedirect():
curl_easy_setopt(d-\>m_handle, CURLOPT_SHARE, 0);

#### v9.6

WebKit/OSS code was actually updated. ExeFS .code was updated. The
following files in RomFS were updated:

- "/banner/CN/Skater.icn" and "/banner/KR/Skater.icn".
- "/browser/rootca.pem"
- "/build/buildinfo.dat"
- "/cairo.cro.lex" and "/.crr/static.crr"
- "/lyt/Button/ButtonSelectHSearch.arc"
- "/lyt/Kbd/Swkbd.arc"
- "lyt/Kbd.arc"
- "skater.msbt" under all of the "/message/<region>_<language>/"
  directories.
- "/oss.cro.lex", "/peer.cro.lex", "/static.crs", and "/webkit.cro.lex".

The following was added to RomFS:

- "/favicon/naver.dat"
- A "KO" directory under "/iwnn".

#### v9.9

ExeFS:/.code was updated.

The only RomFS changes is file-updating, all of the following files were
updated:

```
/browser/rootca.pem
/build/buildinfo.dat
/cairo.cro.lex
/.crr/static.crr

```

See [here](https://gist.github.com/yellows8/9fb509fde4112339f342) for a
diff of the OSS(WebKitLibraries/ is not included due to the massive
cairo library diff). An exploitable security vuln(which was already
known in the context of 3DS webkit) was fixed.
[Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink")' private(at the time of writing)
exploit for it is based on the PoC from
[here](http://pastebin.com/ufBCQKda)(see the pastebin for the actual
pastebin author).

#### v10.2

The libstagefright build in the main SKATER codebin was updated to a
version which fixed libstagefright vuln(s): the vuln used in
[browserhax_fright](browserhax "wikilink") at the time of sysupdate
release was fixed. The \*only\* code changed in the main codebin, was
code related to libstagefright.

The only RomFS changes is file-updating, all of the following files were
updated(see the forced-sysupdate section regarding what changed in the
message files):

```

#### v10.4

The ExeFS codebin was updated, the only change was that the following
code was updated in the actual NupCheck HTTPS request function:

- Previous version: sprintf(out,
  "[https://cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net/SNAKE/2/%s](https://cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net/SNAKE/2/%s)",
  region);
- Current version: sprintf(out,
  "[https://cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net/SNAKE/%d/%s](https://cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net/SNAKE/%d/%s)",
  3, region);

libpng was updated from version 1.5.21 to 1.5.24.

The following RomFS files were updated(see the forced-sysupdate section
regarding what changed in the message files):

```
/browser/rootca.pem
/build/buildinfo.dat
/cairo.cro.lex
/.crr/static.crr

/peer.cro.lexÂ differ
/static.crsÂ differ
/webkit.cro.lexÂ differ
```

#### v10.6

The ExeFS codebin was updated.

[browserhax_fright_tx3g](browserhax "wikilink") was fixed. The code
handling tx3g now matches the latest libstagefright git.

Hence the below RomFS listing, no OSS was updated at all(besides
libstagefright mentioned above).

The following RomFS files were updated:

```
/build/buildinfo.dat
/static.crs
```

#### v10.7

Basically the same changes as Old3DS v10.7, except with the usual
buildinfo.dat update in RomFS. The below date is 6 days after the
browser-version-check [bypass](3DS_Userland_Flaws "wikilink") was
publicly disclosed.

```
catÂ v7184/00000025_romfs/build/buildinfo.dat
10150
applet
2016-03-02Â 18:25
```

#### v11.1

The ExeFS codebin was updated. The following files in RomFS were
updated:

```
Â /build/buildinfo.dat
Â /.crr/static.crr
Â /oss.cro.lex
Â /static.crs
Â /webkit.cro.lex
```

```
Â catÂ v8192/00000026_romfs/build/buildinfo.dat
Â 10156
Â applet
Â 2016-08-26Â 19:47
```

Minus the 4 functions that changed due to compiler optimization, only 1
function was actually updated. This is LT_1a4004, previous version at
LT_1a4004: libstagefright status_t MPEG4Extractor::parseChunk(off64_t
\*offset, int depth)

Additional code was added which doesn't seem to be from upstream git,
right
[before](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/32d6e5f0ebe9e00f80401e5f4fd6e285a474590d/media/libstagefright/MPEG4Extractor.cpp#880)
the cprt code block: "if((\*offset + chunk_size) - data_offset \<
0)fail"

This fixed skater31hax + any other mp4 haxx which requires using a
negative 64bit chunk_size value.

The filepath base used in the assert strings were changed from
"d:\Jenkins\workspace\MPSkaterBuild\MVPlayer\Skater\Base\Android\frameworks\base\media\libstagefright\\
to
"d:\jenkins\workspace\MPSkaterBuild-Git\Base\Android\frameworks\base\media\libstagefright\\.

#### v11.4

The only changes in RomFS was for "/build/buildinfo.dat" and
"/static.crs", hence no OSS in CRO(s) were updated.

The main codebin was updated. Exactly two functions were updated, these
are not related to code exec vulns.

  it's displayed.)"

MJPEG + .avi is also supported.

#### Gamepad

The browser's now-outdated gamepad API provides information about the
states of the circle pad, C-stick, and every button aside from the Home
and Power buttons. The gamepad, which has an ID of
`New Nintendo 3DS Controller`, is contained within the array returned by
the `navigator.webkitGetGamepads` function.

Both of the gamepad's arrays, which contain the states of various
inputs, seem to be reconstructed each time they are accessed via their
gamepad object. It is not known if the values within the arrays can
update upon each access of the array, but the values <em>can</em> update
frequently enough to obtain accurate readings of the system's controls.

##### Axes

The gamepad's `axes` array contains four floating-point numbers in the
following order:

| Index | Axis         |
|-------|--------------|
| 0     | Circle pad X |
| 1     | Circle pad Y |
| 2     | C-stick X    |
| 3     | C-stick Y    |

Each coordinate ranges from -1.0 (left/up) to 1.0 (right/down). Neutral
position is indicated by 0.0. Drift and/or inaccurate calibration may
make these exact values unattainable.

##### Buttons

The gamepad's `buttons` array contains numbers for the following
numbers:

| Index | Button |
|-------|--------|
| 0     | B      |
| 1     | A      |
| 2     | Y      |
| 3     | X      |
| 4     | L      |
| 5     | R      |
| 6     | ZL     |
| 7     | ZR     |
| 8     | Select |
| 9     | Start  |
| 10    | Unused |
| 11    | Unused |
| 12    | Up     |
| 13    | Down   |
| 14    | Left   |
| 15    | Right  |

Each button's value is 0 while the button is not pressed, and 1 while
the button is pressed.

Based on the Gamepad API's specifications, buttons 10 and 11 are
reserved for left stick presses and right stick presses respectively,
which the 3DS does not support.

#### Notes

- Viewport information can be specified with the `<meta>` element.
- The html "color" `<input>` type is not supported.
- 3D images appear as their right-eye image within webpages.
- Webpages are locked to the bottom screen when zooming is disabled, the
  webpage's initial scale is 1, and the entire webpage can fit within
  the bottom screen's dimensions (320x212).
- Interactable elements that are positioned partially outside of the
  bottom screen can temporarily be moved further inside the bottom
  screen by tapping them with the touchscreen.
- Favicons can be changed using Javascript, but they become unchangeable
  once the document's <em>readystatechange</em> event finishes firing
  with a ready state of "complete".
- Focusing on text-editable elements via Javascript will always open the
  keyboard.
- Webpage content is usually rendered at 30 FPS despite the
  `webkitRequestAnimationFrame` function allowing code to run at a rate
  of 60 FPS.
  - As a result, display-related routines may only show half of their
    intended updates.
  - This issue can be mitigated by rendering on every other frame.
    However, various factors (such as touchscreen input and sleep mode)
    make this fairly inconsistent.

0x01A97000. The size used by the CHN and TWN browser is 0x01997000,
exactly 0x100000-bytes smaller.

### Old3DS v9.9

### Old3DS v10.2

The slider vuln from [here](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_webkithax)
was fixed in the Old3DS browser.

The main codebin .text only increased by 0x10-bytes.

### Old3DS v10.6

[spider28hax](browserhax "wikilink") was fixed. The "2^32 characters
long string" vuln described [here](3DS_Userland_Flaws "wikilink") was
*finally* fixed.

*A lot* of WebKit issues/vulns were fixed, see
[here](https://gist.github.com/yellows8/b1e10caa1d8bb8a46316) for the
changes.

libpng was updated from version 1.4.12 to 1.4.19. zlib was updated from
1.2.7 to 1.2.8.

The .text size increased by 0x478-bytes.

The only changes in RomFS was that the following files were updated:

```
/cro/oss.cro
/cro/static.crs
/cro/webkit.cro
/.crr/static.crr
/manual/Manual.bcma
```

### Old3DS v10.7

*Nothing* changed except some words for version-values in .text being
updated(RomFS wasn't changed), code for browser-version-check was
[updated](#v10.7_2 "wikilink").

### Old3DS v11.1

Nothing changed in the ExeFS codebin besides the usual version values.
The following files in RomFS were updated:

```
Â /cro/oss.cro
Â /cro/webkit.cro
Â /.crr/static.crr
```

## Forced system-update

The Old3DS/New3DS Internet Browser updated with
[9.9.0-26](9.9.0-26 "wikilink") added the following message strings:

```
InÂ orderÂ toÂ useÂ theÂ InternetÂ 
browser,Â aÂ systemÂ updateÂ 
isÂ required.
ToÂ performÂ aÂ systemÂ update,Â 
selectÂ SystemÂ UpdateÂ fromÂ Other
SettingsÂ inÂ SystemÂ Settings.
```

```
TheÂ InternetÂ browserÂ cannotÂ be
usedÂ atÂ thisÂ time.
PleaseÂ checkÂ yourÂ network
environmentÂ orÂ tryÂ againÂ later.
```

For whatever reason, the above *message strings* were removed with
New3DS-browser v10.2, then re-added with v10.4. This does not apply to
the Old3DS browser. Whenever v10.2 New3DS browser tries to use these
message-strings for displaying a browser-update-related message, it will
crash due to an assert failing since the message-strings are missing.
Hence, if/when the v10.2 update-check page is ever updated where the
browser tries to display a message for it, or when accessing that page
fails, the browser will automatically crash.

This wasn't enforced(web-browser displaying the above message when the
installed browser isn't the latest version) until October 26, 2015.

This message only triggers when attempting to load a web-page. This is
only handled the first time the browser accesses a web-page, during this
browser session.

The browser codebins starting with v9.9 now contain the following URL
strings:

- Old3DS: `https://cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net/CTR/1/\<region\>`
- New3DS: `https://cbvc.cdn.nintendo.net/SNAKE/1/\<region\>`

The `<region>` string is one of the following:

- "JPN"
- "USA"
- "EUR"
- "KOR"

Starting with the browser from [10.2.0-28](10.2.0-28 "wikilink"), the
"1" in the above URLs were changed to "2". With the New3DS browser from
[10.4.0-29](10.4.0-29 "wikilink"), it's now "3".

As of October 26, 2015, the "1" URLs return the browser-version for
v9.9(decimal number as a string without any "."), while the "2" URLs
returns 0.

```
if(internal_browserverÂ >Â server_browserver)
{
Â Â Â Â <safe>
}
else
{
Â Â Â Â <update message>
}
```

Hence, internal_browserver == server_browserver will trigger the
sysupdate message, which appears to be the normal way to indicate that
the current browser is outdated(see above).

There is a cache for this in savedata. The request is only done when at
least 24-hours have passed since the last time the request was done(see
the below savedata section).

It is still possible to guard against this update by blocking the
previous URLs using a proxy. It is not possible to remove the update
message by entering the [Recovery Mode](Recovery_Mode "wikilink").

### Page request

For this request, all root-CAs bundled with the browser are trusted, in
addition to two of the SSL module builtin Nintendo root-CAs.

The browser(with New3DS at least) does the following with
[HTTPC](HTTP_Services "wikilink") for requesting the above page:

- Initializes the HTTP context and uses
  [HTTPC:InitializeConnectionSession](HTTPC:InitializeConnectionSession "wikilink") +
  [HTTPC:SetProxyDefault](HTTPC:SetProxyDefault "wikilink").
- Uses [HTTPC](HTTP_Services "wikilink") command 0x250080 twice with
  cmd\[1\]=contexthandle: first time cmd\[2\]=0x3, second time
  cmd\[2\]=0x6.
- Then [HTTPC:AddTrustedRootCA](HTTPC:AddTrustedRootCA "wikilink") is
  used 48 times to setup 48 trusted root CAs. This appears to be every
  cert in the browser "romfs:/browser/rootca.pem" file converted to DER,
  in the same order from there(in other words, every single root CA the
  browser trusts by default for normal web-browsing).
- Then [HTTPC:BeginRequest](HTTPC:BeginRequest "wikilink") is used.
- Then [HTTPC:ReceiveDataTimeout](HTTPC:ReceiveDataTimeout "wikilink")
  is used, the recv-size seems to be fixed to 0x20.
- Then
  [HTTPC:GetResponseStatusCodeTimeout](HTTPC:GetResponseStatusCodeTimeout "wikilink")
  is used.
- Then
  [HTTPC:GetDownloadSizeState](HTTPC:GetDownloadSizeState "wikilink") is
  used.
- Then the HTTP context is closed.

Raw request data(New3DS USA v10.2 browser):

```
000000:Â 47Â 45Â 54Â 20Â 2fÂ 53Â 4eÂ 41Â 4bÂ 45Â 2fÂ 32Â 2fÂ 55Â 53Â 41Â Â GETÂ /SNAKE/2/USA
000010:Â 20Â 48Â 54Â 54Â 50Â 2fÂ 31Â 2eÂ 31Â 0dÂ 0aÂ 48Â 6fÂ 73Â 74Â 3aÂ Â Â HTTP/1.1..Host:

```

### v10.7

The only actual code change with Old3DS/New3DS browser v10.7 was that
the code which calculates the diff_timestamp was moved to immediately
after the block which initializes <state_timestamp> when
<state_timestamp> is all-zero. This fixed the browser-version-check
[bypass](3DS_Userland_Flaws "wikilink").

## Dummy web-browser

Gamecards v9.9 and above include, with their sysupdate, a dummy
Old3DS/New3DS web-browser. The \*only\* thing this title does is display
the same message listed in the above forced-update section. The message
files in RomFS \*only\* contain that message string above. There are no
"http" strings in the main codebin, and [RO](RO_Services "wikilink")
isn't used either(no CRO data in RomFS at all). Both browsers are
internally called "dummySpider".

Hence, if you update your system below v9.8 with any v9.9 or above
gamecard, the system web-browser will be rendered \*completely\* useless
until you install a system-update from CDN(no network requests involved
here).

Gamecards v10.7 and v11.4(New3DS only) have updated the dummy
web-browser, where the only difference is the title version.

## Savedata

### New3DS

On newer SKATER versions, it appears \*all\* NAND savedata is stored
under the [0x000200BB](System_SaveData "wikilink") savedata.

#### 0x000200BB savedata

This only contains "t.bin" with filesize 0xadf80, the format is below.

The timestamp format used here is the number of milliseconds since
January 1, 2000(local-time).

When using the "Initialize savedata" option in the browser, that deletes
this savedata file/image then exits the browser. This file is then
re-created when the browser gets started again.

| Offset | Size  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x68   | 0x4?  | This counter is incremented each time the savedata is written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 0x70   | 0x8   | Timestamp for when the savedata was last written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 0x94   | 0x15? | This is all-zeros on non-JPN systems.

| 0xD8   | 0x8   | s64 timestamp, can be either a normal positive timestamp or a relative negative one. Used with the forced-update described above. When an update is detected this timestamp is negative, otherwise this is a normal positive timestamp(it's unknown how exactly this timestamp is checked). When positive, this seems to be the last time the forced-update HTTPS request was done where no update was needed. |

## APT Parameters

The URL to load can optionally be loaded from char\[\] string
[paramblk+0](APT:SendParameter "wikilink"). This is used when scanning
URL QR-codes in Home Menu / etc.

## Errors

"Failed to load part of this page": This can be caused by failing to
load "/favicon.ico". For example, this can be caused by loading a plain
HTTP page, with plain-http favicon redirecting to HTTPS. If cert-verify
then fails with favicon in this case, this error would then trigger.

## Other details

- It scored 90/100 on [Acid3](http://acid3.acidtests.org/) test
- Images from the Internet can be saved to the [SD
  Card](SD_Filesystem "wikilink") and viewed using the [Nintendo 3DS
  Camera](Nintendo_3DS_Camera "wikilink") application.
- Images saved to an [SD Card](SD_Filesystem "wikilink") or to the
  Nintendo 3DS system memory can be uploaded to blogs or other sites
  that allow the uploading of photos using :

```
<input type="file" />
```

- HTML5Test.com say that Drag and drop is supported but it's not (code
  on WebKit is ready, but it's not implemented on interface of browser)
- Webpages are rendered with the RGB565 color format.

## Tips

### Detect User Agent

To detect if the user agent is the Nintendo 3DS Internet Browser (not
including mobile site mode):

```
<script type="text/javascript">
Â Â Â Â if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf("NintendoÂ 3DS")Â ==Â -1)Â {Â //Â IfÂ theÂ userÂ agentÂ doesÂ notÂ containÂ "NintendoÂ 3DS"
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â location.replace("https://example.com");Â //Â RedirectÂ toÂ anotherÂ page
Â Â Â Â }
</script>
```

- You can check using `navigator.platform.indexOf("Nintendo 3DS") > -1`
  as well.
- The New 3DS Internet Browser's "Request Mobile Sites" setting affects
  the user agent. To detect if the New 3DS Internet Browser is being
  used with this option enabled, use
  `screen.pixelDepth == 16 && navigator.platform == "iPhone"`.
  - This relies on the fact that the internet browser renders its
    webpages in 16-bit color, which is (hopefully?) not possible with a
    real iPhone.
  - Keep in mind that the previous browser-detection examples do not
    account for this setting.

### Scrolling

Scrolling can be altered by modifying <em>document.body.scrollTop</em>
and <em>document.body.scrollLeft</em>. However, there are drawbacks
related to working with these properties:

- Both properties return 0 when accessed
- Setting one property resets the other property's scroll position

In order to set both at the same time (without either resetting to 0),
use <em>window.scrollTo</em>.

### Events

#### Key Events

The following buttons trigger the <em>onkeydown</em>,
<em>onkeypress</em> and <em>onkeyup</em> events:

| Code | Button |
|------|--------|
| 13   | A      |
| 37   | Left   |
| 38   | Up     |
| 39   | Right  |
| 40   | Down   |

The events cannot have their default action cancelled. Other buttons do
not trigger key events.

The Old3DS browser dispatches a <em>keypress</em> event once per key
press for each of the buttons above, but the New3DS browser dispatches
the event continuously until the button is released.

A keyboard event's `keyIdentifier` property usually should not be used
to identify which button was pressed, as the A button's
<em>keypress</em> event is dispatched with a key identifier of "" (an
empty string) rather than "Enter" in the New3DS browser.

The New3DS browser's keyboard dispatches <em>keydown</em> and
<em>keyup</em> events when a key is pressed, but it is not possible to
determine which key was pressed based on the event itself. Every
keyboard <em>keydown</em> event has a key code of 229 and a key
identifier of "U+00E5", and every <em>keyup</em> event has a key code of
0 and a key identifier of "U+0000".

Key events are suppressed while the touchscreen is touched.

#### Touch/Mouse Events

The <em>mousedown</em>, <em>mouseup</em>, and <em>click</em> events are
all triggered by the browser. However, the <em>mousedown</em> event
doesn't trigger until you lift the stylus or you've held it on the
screen long enough to trigger text selection mode. Text selection mode
requires pressing the touchscreen for approximately 1.05 seconds in the
Old3DS browser, or pressing the touchscreen for approximately 0.41
seconds in the New3DS browser. Also, the <em>mousedown</em> event is
only dispatched while text selection mode is active. Mouse events cannot
have their default actions cancelled.

Touch events are not supported in the Old3DS browser, and the
<em>touchcancel</em> event does not seem to be used by either browser.
Touches cannot start within the bottom browser bar, but they can move to
be within it. The rotation angle, contact radii, and pressure of each
touch are always zero, as the 3DS touchscreen is not capable of
detecting these values. Only one touch can be detected at a time due to
the touchscreen's hardware limitations as well. Unlike mouse events,
touch events can have their default actions cancelled. Doing so will
prevent the touchscreen from being used to scroll through the webpage,
highlight text, zoom out, and interact with the bottom browser bar.

#### System Font Characters

The [system
font](System_Font#Unicode_Private_Use_characters "wikilink")'s
private-use characters can be viewed within the web browser.

## Screen Resolution

The up screen resolution is 400Ã240. However, the viewable area in the
browser is only <b>400Ã215</b>.

The touch screen resolution is 320Ã240. However, the viewable area in
the browser is <b>320Ã212</b> <em>or</em> <b>320Ã240</b>, depending on
if the bottom browser bar is visible. The New3DS browser's bottom bar
can hidden by scrolling and/or attempting to zoom in/out with the
C-stick, unless scrolling and zooming have both been disabled.

You can have a page span both screens. However, the browser will behave
as if the bottom screen is the only active screen and the top screen is
scrolled off. This is important when computing CSS coordinates. Items
positioned from the "bottom" will be positioned based on the height of
the bottom screen, not the cumulative height of both screens.

## Using Both Screens

Generally the easiest way to accomplish the correct layout is to create
HTML elements that "contain" the top and bottom screens. Here's an
example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=400, initial-scale=1">
    <style>
      body { margin: 0px; }
      #topscreen { width: 400px; height: 215px; overflow: hidden; background-color: red; }
      #bottomscreen { width: 320px; height: 212px; overflow: hidden; background-color: blue; margin: 0 40px 28px; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="topscreen">Top Screen</div>
    <div id="bottomscreen">Bottom Screen</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

This scheme allows the page to be easily manipulated through JavaScript.
In order to have the window snap to the correct position, use the
following JavaScript code:

```
window.setInterval(function()Â {
Â Â Â Â window.scrollTo(40,Â 215);
},Â 0);
```

This automatically resets the position if the user accidentally scrolls
the page. Zooming should probably also be disabled by adding
`user-scalable=no` to the `<meta>` viewport element, though this will only have an effect in the New3DS
browser.
