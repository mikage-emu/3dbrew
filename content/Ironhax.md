title = 'Ironhax'

Ironhax is an exploit in the USA/EUR eShop game "IronFall: Invasion"
that allows people to load 3DS homebrew on system versions 9.5-10.0 and
above. "IronFall: Invasion" was removed for initial download from
Nintendo eShop as of August 11th, 2015. On October 13, 2015, the main
app title was restored on the eShop with an update included with that
title itself: since that version fixed the vuln used by this exploit, a
version older than this one is required if you really want to use this
exploit. Unlike other exploits this is a secondary exploit, meaning in
order to install it the use of another exploit with the Homebrew
Launcher is required. The Ironhax installer requires internet,
afterwards the installed exploit will work without internet.

See here for \*all\* setup instructions: [3DS homebrew official
site](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/).

Sometimes the 3DS might get stuck at a blue screen or a white screen
(bottom touch screen) and if this happens force shut your 3DS down by
holding the power button until the blue light turns off and then try the
whole exploit again.

Also keep in mind that Ironhax is a Userland exploit, meaning that it
has only ARM11-userland access and doesn't have ARM11-kernel. This means
we can't modify the system but that doesn't mean we can't do some
awesome homebrew! Regionfree, emulators, custom homemenu themes,
playcoin hacks, etc. are all available!
