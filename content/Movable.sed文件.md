| 0x110    | 0x10  | [AES](AES "wikilink") engine keyY for 3 keyslots (High u64 is unsigned) |

This keyY is the console-unique portion of the 3 keyslots used for
everything stored under [sdmc/Nintendo
3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>](SD_Filesystem "wikilink") and
[nand/data/<ID0>](Flash_Filesystem "wikilink"). For SD this is used for
encryption and AES MACs, however for NAND this is only used for AES
MACs. This file is transferred to the destination 3DS during a [System
Transfer](System_Transfer "wikilink"). The movable.sed keyY high u64 is
[updated](FS:InitializeCtrFileSystem "wikilink") on the source 3DS
during a [System Transfer](System_Transfer "wikilink"), and when doing a
system format with [System Settings](System_Settings "wikilink").

Movable.sed always exists on retail(written to NAND at the factory),
however if this file doesn't exist the system will fall-back to using a
console-unique keyY already in
[memory](PSPXI:GetLocalFriendCodeSeed "wikilink"), with the last 8-bytes
being loaded from the 8-bytes following that u64. It's unknown whether
movable.sed exists on development units.

The keyY is hashed with SHA256, the first 0x10-bytes from the hash is
used with the below snprintf for ID0 in [sdmc/Nintendo
3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>](SD_Filesystem "wikilink") and
[nand/data/<ID0>](Flash_Filesystem "wikilink"). ID0 is generated by:
snprintf(outdirname, maxlen, "%08x%08x%08x%08x", hashword\[0\],
hashword\[1\], hashword\[2\], hashword\[3\]).
