These NWM services are used for local-WLAN communications, NWM module
handles regular wifi APs as well. These services are used for
creating/connecting to networks, and for sending/receiving data over the
network etc. NWM module uses the wifi SDIO hardware via the IO registers
for this.

# NWM local-WLAN service "nwm::UDS"

| Command Header | Available since system version           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 0x000102C2     |                                          | Initialize Deprecated. Appears to be handled about the same way as [NWMUDS:InitializeWithVersion](NWMUDS:InitializeWithVersion "wikilink"), except this uses version=0x100 internally instead of loading it from the command request. |
| 0x00020000     |                                          | Scrap Not used by sub-wars. This sets a state value to 0x2 then signals an event. This is probably some sort of shutdown command since this state write will result in all UDS commands returning an error if used afterwards.        |

This section describes the 0x34-byte input structure used by
[NWMINF:RecvBeaconBroadcastData](NWMINF:RecvBeaconBroadcastData "wikilink")
and
[NWMUDS:RecvBeaconBroadcastData](NWMUDS:RecvBeaconBroadcastData "wikilink").

# Local-WLAN

UDS is used for 3DS\<\>3DS local-WLAN communications, and for 3DS\<\>Wii
U communications. The latter is mainly only used for multi-player in
games.

All UDS local-WLAN communications have the CCMP key for data encryption
generated via NWM module. The CCMP key passed to nwm::CEC
commands(stored in a 0x44-byte input structure) for
[StreetPass](StreetPass "wikilink") is generated by the CECD module. The
input data used with [EncryptDecryptAes](Process_Services "wikilink")
with [keytype1](PSPXI:EncryptDecryptAes "wikilink") is a MD5 hash over
the input passphrase. This input passphrase is fixed for [Download
Play](Download_Play "wikilink"), it's unique per local-WLAN application.
The CTR is a MD5 hash over the below 0x10-byte structure. The output
from encrypting that data with AES-CTR is the final CCMP key. This
passphrase is a raw input buffer: while the passphrase specified by
user-processes is normally a string with the NUL-terminator included, it
can be anything(like the
[WirelessRebootPassphrase](DLP_Services "wikilink") for example).

The maximum number of nodes(including the host) which can be on an UDS
network is 16.

## NodeID

There are two types of client connections: regular Client, and
Spectator. The latter *never* sends *any* 802.11 frame at all to the
host, hence *nothing* actually connected to the network(including the
host) can know about any spectators. Once a spectator is "connected" to
a network, it can only receive broadcasted data, no sending.

DLP-client connects to the network as a spectator during DLP scanning to
get various [metadata](Download_Play "wikilink") including icon data.

### NetworkNodeID

This is the network u16 ID for each device on the UDS network. NodeID
0xFFFF is a broadcast alias. 0x1 is for the host, the 0x2 for the first
client, 0x3 for the second client, and so on.

The spectator doesn't have a NetworkNodeID, since it can't
[send](NWMUDS:SendTo "wikilink") any data.

NetworkNodeIDs for clients do not change when any clients disconnect,
likewise for the encrypted node-listing stored in the wifi beacons. When
a client disconnects, the corresponding NetworkNodeID bit in the
[node_bitmask](NWMUDS:GetConnectionStatus "wikilink") is cleared. When a
client is connecting, the client is assigned the NetworkNodeID with the
lowest corresponding clear-bit in the
[node_bitmask](NWMUDS:GetConnectionStatus "wikilink"), then that bit is
set.

### BindNodeID

This u32 is an ID only used on the local device. How many devices are on
the network or which device this system is does not affect this ID.

The spectator uses BindNodeID 0x1. DLP uses BindNodeID 0x3 when
connecting as an actual client. Hence, it seems BindNodeID bit0 is
spectator-related. All normal nodes(host/client) start with BindNodeID
0x2. When connecting to a network again(and probably with network
creation) without reinitializing NWMUDS, official user processes
increase the used BindNodeID by 0x2.

BindNodeID value 0x0 is invalid. The maximum number of BindNodeIDs which
can be open at the same time is 16.

## Application data transfer

The protocol used for sending/receiving data over the network with UDS
by official applications is [PRUDP](PRUDP "wikilink")(in some cases at
least). Mario Kart 7 uses PRUDP here. Triforce Heroes uses plaintext for
whatever protocol it uses for UDS.

The UDS version of [PRUDP](PRUDP "wikilink") is different from the
normal UDP version it appears(no afa1/a1af data for example).

## Communication protocol

The process of connecting to a host and exchanging data follows the
sequence:

Client-\>Server: Authentication frame SEQ1

Server-\>Client: Authentication frame SEQ2

\[There does not appear to be an association request frame sent by the
client to the server, it is however possible that it was sent and just
not captured by the test equipment\]

Server-\>Client: Association Response frame with association id

\[From here on, the client is connected to the server\]

Client-\>Server: Encrypted data packet containing an 8-byte 802.2 LLC
header with ethertype = EAPoL (0x888E) and an u16 header of 0x201
([EAPoL-Start](NWM_Services#EAPoL-Start_frame "wikilink"))

Server-\>Broadcast: Encrypted data packet containing the updated node
information after the client connected (Using ethertype = SecureData).

Server-\>Client: Encrypted data packet containing an 8-byte 802.2 LLC
header with ethertype = EAPoL (0x888E) and an u16 header of
0x0202([EAPoL-Logoff](NWM_Services#EAPoL-Logoff_frame "wikilink"))

\[From here on, data packets sent using SendTo are encapsulated with an
LLC header with ethertype = 0x876D
([SecureData](NWM_Services#SecureData_NWM_header "wikilink"))\]

\[The client also sends periodic SecureData data frames on its own,
these are probably ping frames\]

## Data frames

Data is transferred over the network using
[NWMUDS:PullPacket](NWMUDS:PullPacket "wikilink")/[NWMUDS:SendTo](NWMUDS:SendTo "wikilink").
That data is transferred using 802.11 data frames using CCMP encryption.
The encrypted data contained in the frame starts with the 0x8-byte [LLC
header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork_Access_Protocol#Use),
then the 0xE-byte NWM header, followed by the actual application data
from the previously mentioned commands. When
[NWMUDS:SendTo](NWMUDS:SendTo "wikilink") was used with dst_NodeID =
broadcast, the data frame is sent to the 802.11 broadcast MAC address.
Otherwise with a specific NodeID, the data frame is sent to the actual
MAC address for that device.

Official application data is normally stored here as big-endian.

Application data packets are sent to the host using 802.11 unicast,
which then acts as a router and forwards the packet to the right
destination node id based on the SecureData header using either
broadcast or unicast, it is not yet known how it chooses which to use.

| Offset | Size | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 0x8  | u64 ID, this is the UDS version of the FriendCodeSeed. This is loaded from BlkID 0x00090000 in the [system-config](Config_Savegame "wikilink") via [CfgS:GetConfigInfoBlk2](CfgS:GetConfigInfoBlk2 "wikilink").                                                                          |

However, the data at +0x14(absolute offset 0x1C) is written by NWM-module later. |
| 0x1C   | 0x2  | u16, unknown. Set to 0x0 with the output from [NWMUDS:DecryptBeaconData](NWMUDS:DecryptBeaconData "wikilink").                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 0x1E   | 0x1  | u8 flag, unknown. Originates from the u16 bitmask in the beacon node-list header. This flag is normally 0 since that bitmask is normally 0?                                                                                                                                              |

The first 0x20-bytes are written by the user-process before using this
structure with
[NWMUDS:InitializeWithVersion](NWMUDS:InitializeWithVersion "wikilink").
The data starting at offset 0x8 is only initialized by NWM-module.

## UDS Beacons

The UDS host broadcasts a beacon containing at least two Nintendo-vendor
tags(tag number 0xDD, see above for the OUI), normally the data stored
in these tags are static. The second tag contains the big-endian u32
networkID, used by the clients when connecting to the host and for the
above CCMP key generation. The Nintendo-vendor tag(s) following the
first two are unique to the process using UDS, these tags are used for
broadcasting metadata regarding the host.

A tool for these beacons is available here:
[1](https://github.com/yellows8/ctr-wlanbeacontool)

### UDS Beacon Tags

The following is the structure of each tag, starting at the OUI. The
order of the tags is the same as listed below. All data stored under
these tags are stored as big-endian.

#### OUI Type 20

| Offset | Size | Description           |
|--------|------|-----------------------|
| 0x0    | 0x3  | OUI, see above.       |
| 0x3    | 0x1  | OUI type (20/0x14)    |
| 0x4    | 0x3  | Sample data: 0a 00 00 |

Normally the size of this tag(from the tag size field) is 0x07.

#### OUI Type 21

| Offset | Size | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 0x1F | This is the network structure starting at offset 0xC, with the first 0x1F-bytes from there.                                                                          |
| 0x1F   | 0x14 | SHA1 hash. When doing the hashing, this hash is cleared to zero. The hash data starts at offset 0x0(OUI), and the size is 0x34 + \<value of the u8 at offset 0x33\>. |
| 0x33   | 0x1  | Size of appdata. Normally zero. When non-zero this appdata is located at offset 0x34.                                                                                |

Normally the size of this tag(from the tag size field) is 0x34, not
including appdata.

#### OUI Type 24

| Offset | Size      | Description        |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| 0x0    | 0x3       | OUI, see above.    |
| 0x3    | 0x1       | OUI type (24/0x18) |
| 0x4    | See below | Encrypted data     |

This is the tag0 used with
[NWMUDS:DecryptBeaconData](NWMUDS:DecryptBeaconData "wikilink"). The
size of data stored under this tag has a maximum size of 0xFA-bytes,
however normally the size is smaller than that. Additional encrypted
data, if any, is stored under the below tag1.

#### OUI Type 25

| Offset | Size      | Description        |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| 0x0    | 0x3       | OUI, see above.    |
| 0x3    | 0x1       | OUI type (25/0x19) |
| 0x4    | See above | Encrypted data     |

When this exists in the beacon, this is the tag1 used with
[NWMUDS:DecryptBeaconData](NWMUDS:DecryptBeaconData "wikilink"). The
data stored here is the 0xFA-bytes following the previous encrypted data
in tag0, for more space for storing the encrypted data.

#### Encrypted beacon data

The following structure is for the plaintext version of the encrypted
data, stored as big-endian.

This data is encrypted with AES-CTR, by NWM module in software. The AES
key is stored in NWM module itself. See above for the CTR. The size of
this encrypted data is 0x12 + (0x1E\*val), where val is the u8 from
networkstruct offset 0x1D.

##### Structure

| Offset | Size                          | Description                                                                                                                             |
|--------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 0x10                          | MD5 over the rest of the data following this(plaintext).                                                                                |
| 0x10   | 0x2                           | u16 bitmask. Unknown, normally 0? Bit0 is for entry0, bit1 for entry1, and so on.                                                       |
| 0x12   | 0x1E \* <total array entries> | This is an array of entries for each of the devices on this network, the first entry is for the host and the rest is for the client(s). |

##### Array entry

| Offset | Size | Description                                                                   |
|--------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0    | 0x1C | This is the first 0x1C-bytes of the NodeInfo structure, stored as big-endian. |
| 0x1C   | 0x2  | u16 NetworkNodeID, stored as big-endian.                                      |

Each entry is for a node.
