  menuhax
  [v3.1](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_homemenuhax/releases/tag/v3.1),
  and updated the starter-kit. The sploit_installer build from the
  starter-kit now supports all regions for stickerhax except CHNTWN.
  This also sends the Home Menu title-version for the initial \*hax
  payload network request, unless the user changed the system-info(like
  the latest menuhax_manager and hblauncher_loader).
- **9 August 16** An updated version of USA SmileBASIC is now
  available(the updated JPN version was released exactly 2 weeks ago).
- **29 July 16** [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") released
  [stickerhax](https://github.com/yellows8/stickerhax), which supports
  \<=[11.0.0-33](11.0.0-33 "wikilink").
- **27 July 16** [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") released new
  browserhax(see changelog [here](browserhax "wikilink")) and menuhax
  [v3.0](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_homemenuhax/releases), all of
  these now support [11.0.0-33](11.0.0-33 "wikilink").
- **26 July 16** Various JPN-only eShop app updates were released. This
  includes JPN SmileBASIC: the update-title was removed from
  versionlist, and the main-title was updated. Updating an already
  installed version of the game will currently update to 3.3.1.
  Uninstalling and redownloading will give you 3.3.2.
  [smilehax](https://plutooo.github.io/smilehax/) was fixed in
  [3.3.2](http://smilebasic.com/debug/).
- **22 July 16** [Dazzozo](User:Dazzozo "wikilink") released [humblehax
  v2](https://citizens.salthax.org/), supporting the Citizens of Earth
  update released on the eShop 3 days ago.
- **20 July 16** [plutoo](User:Plutooo "wikilink") (with help from
  [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink")) released
  [smilehax](https://plutooo.github.io/smilehax/).
- **19 July 16** An updated version of the EUR "Citizens of Earth"
  regular-title is now available on the EUR-eShop, ~2 months after being
  originally removed. Likewise for USA on the 21st.
- **18 July 16** [Smea](User:Smea "wikilink") updated the hosted \*hax
  payload builds(only otherapp for non-KOR) and this
  [page](https://smealum.github.io/3ds/). KOR is now supported thanks to
  d3m3vilurr(system-version \>=v9.6). All otherapp payloads were
  rebuilt+updated, hence these now include a commit for
  compression(committed by [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") with
  compression code by mtheall). Due to this, oot3dhax+payload can now be
  installed with multiple other normal save-files, without any
  issues(via sploit_installer from the starter-kit).
  [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") also updated the
  [hosted](https://smealum.github.io/3ds/) boot.3dsx to hbmenu 1.1.1.
- **10 July 16** MrNbaYoh released
  [BASICSploit](https://mrnbayoh.github.io/basicsploit/) for version
  3.2.1 of SmileBASIC. Currently only the US version is supported. On
  July 11th the main-app title was removed from USA/JPN eShop: it's no
  longer listed on the former, while on the latter it can't be
  purchased.
- **26 June 16** [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") released oot3dhax
  builds for supporting [11.0.0-33](11.0.0-33 "wikilink"), via updated
  sploit_installer in the [starter-kit](https://smealum.github.io/3ds/)
  and raw
  [saveimages](https://github.com/yellows8/oot3dhax/releases/tag/06-26-16).
  Note that attempting to run sploit_installer on a 11.0.0-33 system
  with \*hax payload \<=v2.7 is equivalent to
  [trying](11.0.0-33 "wikilink") to use the older oot3dhax on that
  version.
- **3 June 16** [plutoo](User:Plutooo "wikilink") released
  [freakyhax](https://plutooo.github.io/freakyhax/). The USA game was
  removed from the eShop \<=3-hours later("... currently unavailable"
  message).
- **9 May 16** Nintendo released system update
  [11.0.0-33](11.0.0-33 "wikilink").
- **24 March 16** Nintendo updated the pages stored on the server used
  for browser-version-check. Due to almost all of the Old3DS/New3DS
  pages for non-latest-browser being updated(content is now "99999"),
  browser versions prior to [10.7.0-32](10.7.0-32 "wikilink") are not
  usable anymore without using the browser-version-check bypass(fixed
  with [10.7.0-32](10.7.0-32 "wikilink")). The only exception is New3DS
  v10.2, it was "updated" but the content is still "0"(this is due to
  browser-version-check being [broken](Internet_Browser "wikilink") with
  New3DS v10.2).
- **22 March 16** [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") released
  [ctr-httpwn](https://github.com/yellows8/ctr-httpwn/releases). v1.0.1
  was released on the 25th for a RootCA cert update.
- **14 March 16** Nintendo released system update
  [10.7.0-32](10.7.0-32 "wikilink").
- **24-25 February 16** On the 24th the Old3DS
  [browser-version-check](Internet_Browser "wikilink") pages were
  updated so that browser version \>=v10.6 is now required. The New3DS
  pages for this were not changed. About 5 hours later,
  [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") disclosed a bypass for the
  browser-version-check. User instructions are available
  [here](http://yls8.mtheall.com/3dsbrowserhax.php), details
  [here](3DS_Userland_Flaws "wikilink").
- **22 February 16** Nintendo released system update
  [10.6.0-31](10.6.0-31 "wikilink").
- **1 February 16** As of this date (time zones notwithstanding)
  following server maintenance Nintendo now checks server-side that
  users are on current firmware before allowing access to online
  functionality in games. See [here](10.5.0-30 "wikilink") for details.

  [10.5.0-30](10.5.0-30 "wikilink").
- **25 January 16** [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") updated
  [browserhax](http://yls8.mtheall.com/3dsbrowserhax.php),
  [menuhax](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_homemenuhax/releases), and
  the oot3dhax
  [saveimages](https://github.com/yellows8/oot3dhax/releases) for v10.4.
- **18 January 16** Nintendo released system update
  [10.4.0-29](10.4.0-29 "wikilink").
- **7 January 16** (roughly, not automatically detected) Ironfall v1.0
  is no longer downloadable due to the main-CXI content files on CDN
  being removed (TMD wasn't removed).
- **27 December 15** A 3DS console hacking
  [talk](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7240.html)
  was at 32C3. A recording can be found
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UutYOidFx3c). Around the end of
  the talk, [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") released
  [browserhax](browserhax "wikilink") and [menuhax](menuhax "wikilink")
  compatible with the latest system-version at the time of release
  ([10.3.0-28](10.3.0-28 "wikilink")). The homebrew
  [starter-kit](https://smealum.github.io/3ds/) was updated for latest
  menuhax, and for an option for downloading the old vulnerable version
  of Ironfall from eShop.
- **15 December 15** Nintendo released Smash Bros update v1.1.3 which
  fixed [smashbroshax](smashbroshax "wikilink"), see
  [here](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_smashbroshax) for details.

  latest firmware: simply remove the update from SD card before

  [hblauncher_loader](https://github.com/yellows8/hblauncher_loader/releases).
- **17-20 November 15** Nintendo released an update for the normal
  (non-invite-code) Super Smash Bros demos in USA, EUR and JPN, fixing
  [smashbroshax](smashbroshax "wikilink"). Only the demos were updated,
  the cartridge and eShop version of the full game are still vulnerable.
- **12 November 15** [Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") released
  [oot3dhax](https://github.com/yellows8/oot3dhax/releases) raw savedata
  images for gamecards with the latest \*hax payloads. The official
  [installer](https://github.com/smealum/sploit_installer) is now
  [included](https://smealum.github.io/3ds/) in the homebrew starter
  kit.
- **9 November 15** Nintendo released system update
  [10.3.0-28](10.3.0-28 "wikilink").
- **2 November 15** Following an eShop servers maintenance, changes to
  the [eShop](eShop "wikilink") system application require an update of
  the Homebrew starter kit for eShop access on system versions older
  than [10.0.0-27](10.0.0-27 "wikilink"). See [here](EShop "wikilink")
  for details.

  browser](Internet_Browser#v9.9_dummy_web-browser "wikilink") is now
  being included in CUPs (cart updates) on Old3DS/New3DS likely starting
  with games shipping [9.9.0-X](9.9.0-26 "wikilink"). NVer is not
  updated by this.
- **26 October 15** The system web-browser on Old3DS/New3DS now displays
  a "sysupdate required" message on systems with
  [9.9.0-26](9.9.0-26 "wikilink") or above installed, if the installed
  browser(?) is not the latest version. See
  [here](Internet_Browser#Forced_system-update "wikilink") for details.

  at the time of sysupdate release, were blocked.
- **15 October 15** The [YouTube](YouTube "wikilink") application was
  updated with a fix for [tubehax](tubehax "wikilink"). This update is
  forced: the app itself checks whether a newer version of the title is
  available.
