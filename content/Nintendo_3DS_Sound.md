Nintendo 3DS Sound is the music playing and audio recording application
that is included with all retail consoles.

## Voice Recorder

Like its predecessor for the DSi, up to 10-second recordings can be
stored, with limited integration of those with other software.

Practically speaking, the [single page of internal
storage](Twln/shared2/0000 "wikilink") is for DSi-mode software, and the
10 pages of SD card storage are for 3DS software (like Flipnote Studio
3D).

### File naming pattern

`   `[`sdmc:`](SD_Filesystem "wikilink")`/Nintendo 3DS/private/00020500/voice/01/V13303.m4a`

- 01: folder (page) number
- 13: file number
- 30: icon color
- 3: icon shape

See the previous link about internal storage for more information about
the numerical values in file names.

## Music Player

It loads audio files from the SD card. It supports MP3 and AAC-encoded
audio files and supports m3u playlists.

### Playlist file format

The application allows for user created playlists. They are stored on
the SD card.

This is a basic example of how to read a 3DS playlist.

## Reading files

The application can read files copied in a folder on the SD card of the
system. The application supports the following files formats:

`   *  .mp3`
`   *  .m4a`
`   *  .mp4`
`   *  .3gp`
