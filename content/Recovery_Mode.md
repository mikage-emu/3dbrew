The recovery mode (also known as Safe Mode Boot) can be accessed when
turning on the Nintendo 3DS while holding A+R+L+Up(DPad). This menu is
made to update your Nintendo 3DS through internet, if an update
previously failed.

However it is possible to use this menu to delete the nagging update
message if your console downloaded an update while in sleep mode. It is
believed that this menu simply erases all update data, as it should
normally be accessed when the update files are corrupted.
