This page describes the format of the icon stored at
[CXI](NCCH#cxi "wikilink") ExeFS:/icon and [CIA](CIA "wikilink") icons.
The size of icons are 0x36c0 bytes. The CXI icon is displayed by [Home
Menu](Home_Menu "wikilink") and [System
Settings](System_Settings "wikilink")(3DS Software Management), while
[CIA icons](CIA#meta "wikilink") are dummies and not yet utilised by Dev
3DS' (as of rev 47586).

- 12th: Traditional Chinese title name

## Application Settings

Most of these flags are only used by the [Home
Menu](Home_Menu "wikilink"). All of these are represented in SMDH files
in little endian. But when documented below, the tables represent values
in big endian.

| START  | SIZE | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                  |

| 0x2034 | 0x4  | CEC (StreetPass) ID (So the Home Menu knows which application icon to show the 'Green' CEC notification for) |

### Region Specific Game Age Ratings

These flags tell the 3DS the 'Age Rating' of the software for the below
regions:

| START  | SIZE | DESCRIPTION         |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| 0x2008 | 0x1  | CERO (Japan)        |
| 0x2009 | 0x1  | ESRB (USA)          |
| 0x200A | 0x1  | Reserved            |
| 0x200B | 0x1  | USK (German)        |
| 0x200C | 0x1  | PEGI GEN (Europe)   |
| 0x200D | 0x1  | Reserved            |
| 0x200E | 0x1  | PEGI PRT (Portugal) |
| 0x200F | 0x1  | PEGI BBFC (England) |
| 0x2010 | 0x1  | COB (Australia)     |
| 0x2011 | 0x1  | GRB (South Korea)   |
| 0x2012 | 0x1  | CGSRR (Taiwan)      |
| 0x2013 | 0x1  | Reserved            |
| 0x2014 | 0x1  | Reserved            |
| 0x2015 | 0x1  | Reserved            |
| 0x2016 | 0x1  | Reserved            |
| 0x2017 | 0x1  | Reserved            |

Active ratings have a bitmask of 0x80, and inactive ratings have no
bitmask at all. Ratings without the 0x80 bitmask are ignored. 0x40
bitmask indicates Rating Pending. 0x20 bitmask indicates No Age
Restriction. Age limits are set by adding the minimal age to 0x80 (for
example, limiting to 12 years and up would give a bitmask of 0x8C)

### Region Lockout

This u32 flag is what the Home Menu uses to determine the [Region
Lockout](Home_Menu#region_lockout "wikilink") of a title.

| REGION        | BITMASK |
|---------------|---------|
| Japan         | 0x01    |
| North America | 0x02    |
| Europe        | 0x04    |
| Australia     | 0x08    |
| China         | 0x10    |
| Korea         | 0x20    |
| Taiwan        | 0x40    |

Regions are 'included' in region lock by setting their bitmask value.
Nintendo defines region free as 0x7fffffff. Early in the 3DS'
development, Nintendo grouped the Australian and Europe markets
together. Nintendo defines market Europe as having the combined bitmasks
of Europe and Australia. No 3DS' which check the Australia bitmask have
been seen (Australia uses the European 3DS model).

### Match Maker IDs

These IDs are an application's online gaming IDs.

| START  | SIZE | DESCRIPTION        |
|--------|------|--------------------|
| 0x201C | 0x4  | Match Maker ID     |
| 0x2020 | 0x8  | Match Maker BIT ID |

### Flags

The u32 is used for storing flags as bit-masks.

| [Region game rating](SMDH#region_specific_game_age_ratings "wikilink") required                                                                                                                                                             | 0x0040        |

| Disables [SD Savedata Backups](SD_Savedata_Backups "wikilink") for this title. This is in addition to [the blacklist](NS_CFA "wikilink").                                                                                                   | 0x0400        |

#### Effect of SaveData and AutoSave

These options have no effect on the performance of the application
itself: they're used to select an appropriate warning when closing an
application from [Home](Home_Menu "wikilink").

- Both off: "Closing software" (no warning if quitting directly with X)
- SaveData: "Do you want to close \[...\]? (Unsaved data will be lost.)"
- AutoSave: ?
- Both on: "Saving data and closing software..." (no warning if quitting
  directly with X)

### EULA Version

This is the EULA version which is checked when the Accept EULA flag is
set, the version is compared to one stored in the 3DS. If the SMDH
version is greater, then the user will be prompted to accept the EULA.

| START  | SIZE | DESCRIPTION        |
|--------|------|--------------------|
| 0x202C | 0x01 | EULA Version Minor |
| 0x202D | 0x01 | EULA Version Major |

### 'Optimal Animation Default Frame' (for BNR)

This is a float, indicating the preferred (or 'most representative')
frame for the banner animation.

### CEC (StreetPass) ID

This u32 represents the application CEC ID. This is likely loaded by
applications for use with the CEC services as well.

## Icon graphics

At offset 0x2040, there are two icons:

| START  | SIZE   | DESCRIPTION                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x2040 | 0x480  | Small - 24x24 (shown on top screen when pausing the app) |
| 0x24C0 | 0x1200 | Large - 48x48 icon (the general icon)                    |

Both of the icons are encoded in RGB565 meaning 16bpp. Although both
icons are known to be RGB565, developers have the option of encoding
icons (and banners) with the following encodings :

- RGBA8
- RGB8
- RGBA5551
- RGB565
- RGBA4
- LA8
- HILO8
- L8
- A8
- LA4
- L4
- ETC1
- ETC1A4

This does not necessarily mean the other encodings will be used, it is
just that those are the options when compiling. Like we've seen with
Super Mario 3D Land Nintendo has changed save file encryption, and
likewise they can encode icons and banners differently *should they
choose to*. Currently we've seen just RGB565 so don't be fooled if an
icon doesn't show up right! It is probably one of these formats above.
Although we will probably not see other formats used for a while it's
nice to know they have an opportunity to change. Also note that it seems
Nintendo stores each pixel in
[word-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_space), so the
actual order of order of each color channel in memory will depend on the
endianness.

The data is encoded in tiles (starting from size 8x8, continuing
recursively).

If the buffer is like this:

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

Then the image would look like this:

| x=0 | x=1 | x=2 | x=3 | x=4 |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 1   | 4   | 5   | 16  |
| 2   | 3   | 6   | 7   | ... |
| 8   | 9   | 12  | 13  |     |
| 10  | 11  | 14  | 15  |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |
