This page talks about the 3DS products' serial number and model number
structures (the console, manual, accessories, games, etc...).

## Console Serial Numbers

A 3DS console serial number is composed of at least two letters followed
by nine decimal digits. The ninth digit is a "check digit", meaning that
it is derived from the other digits.

The check digit is an industry-standard algorithm, the one used for UPC
codes. To calculate the check digit of a 3DS console, separate the
non-check digits into "odd" and "even" groups, where the "odd" group is
digits in odd-numbered positions, and the "even" group is digits in
even-numbered positions. (The first digit is "odd", with "first"
representing "1".)

After separating the digits, add the digits in each group together.
Multiply the sum of the even digits by 3, then add the sum of the odd
digits. To calculate the check digit, take this value modulo 10, and if
not 0, subtract from 10.

Example: CW404567772

The non-check digits are 40456777. Separating into odd and even groups,
we get the following:

Odds: 4 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 21 Evens: 0 + 5 + 7 + 7 = 19

Applying the algorithm, we get ((3 \* 19) + 21) % 10 = 8, which is not
0, thus 10 - 8 = 2, matching the example's check digit.

The letter prefixes are a letter specifying the device, followed by one
letter specifying the region in which it was sold. In some regions, a
third letter is present; a current guess is that this letter
distinguishes among factories for a given sales region. Note that
several different sales regions' console may be considered to be the
same region for region-locking purposes, such as Europe and Australia.

The current serial number scheme began with the DSi, hence its listing
in the tables below. Among standalone consoles, the Wii U belongs to
this scheme as well; the Switch started a new scheme.

| Model               | Device Prefix (Retail) | Device Prefix (Dev/Test) |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| *DSi*               | T                      | V                        |
| *DSi XL/LL*         | W                      | D                        |
| *Nintendo Zone Box* | Z                      | *N/A*                    |
| *Wii U*             | F                      | *unknown*                |
| *Wii U gamepad*     | J                      | J                        |
| 3DS                 | C                      | E                        |
| 3DS XL/LL           | S                      | R                        |
| 2DS                 | A                      | P                        |
| New 3DS             | Y                      | Y                        |
| New 3DS XL/LL       | Q                      | Q                        |
| New 2DS XL/LL       | N                      | N                        |

Some United Kingdom models' serial numbers will include "UH" after the
device model prefix.

Test ("Panda") units with the same prefix as retail can be distinguished
by test units having 00 or 01 as the first two digits of the serial
number portion. 00 was used with the New 3DS and New 3DS XL for test
units; 01 was used with the New 2DS XL test unit. Preview versions of
the N2DS XL given out to the press had 01; these appear to have been
test units with the development titles deleted.

Old 3DS development systems (Partner-CTR, IS-CTR-BOX, IS-SPR-BOX) use
the "E" and "R" prefixes like test systems, but have 90 (Partner-CTR) or
91 (IS-CTR-BOX, IS-SPR-BOX) as their first two digits. Similarly, the
main New 3DS development unit, IS-SNAKE-BOX, uses the Y prefix (same as
retail) with 91. It is currently unknown what is the serial number
format of the rare New 3DS XL development system (IS-CLOSER-BOX).

The DS had the product code NTR (short for Nitro), so we see the TR is
recurring.

## Title ID and Unique ID

*see [Titles](Titles "wikilink")*

## NCCH Product Code

This serial is similiar to the "physical serial" described later in this
page; it is the canonical identifier for a specific title in the field
of business formalities with Nintendo, but this is not reflected in the
3DS's software architecture (where it is vastly unused in favor of the
Title ID: it is therefore considered the successor of the "internal
name" contained in ROMs of previous handhelds), is not guaranteed to be
unique.

The product code is located in a [NCCH](NCCH "wikilink")'s header (not
its ExHeader).

The product code "CTR-P-CTAP" is the default generic product code for
NCCH files. Most [NCCHs apart from the first one](NCSD "wikilink") in a
title are generally CTR-P-CTAP. Referring to "the product code of a
title" is therefore a simplification for "the product code of the NCCH
in its first partition".

So, for example, a Japanese copy of Ridge Racer 3D would have a product
code of "CTR-P-ARRJ" and a serial of "LNA-CTR-ARRJ-JPN".

A Nintendo-assigned product code follows this format, however, there is
no requirement for a product code to match or resemble this structure as
long as it's within the length limit:

\[CTR/KTR\]-\[Category letter\]-\[Type\]\[Identifier\]\[Region\]-\[Sub
ID\]

| Category letter | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P               | Cartridge software, or downloadable versions of them.                                            |
| N               | Digital-only releases, including [system applications and applets](Title_list "wikilink").       |
| M               | [DLC](Title_list/DLC "wikilink")                                                                            |
| T               | [eShop Demos](eShop_Demos "wikilink"), excluding so-called "special demos" which are category N. |
| U               | [Patches](Title_list#0004000e---add-on-content-(updates) "wikilink") for category P titles.      |

The "sub ID" only applies to DLC, demos, and local copies of Download
Play titles. It's a 2-digit number associated with the [Title ID
Variation](Title_list "wikilink").

See the next chapter for explanation of the other components of the
Product Code.

### Electronic Manuals

Some eShop titles have [Electronic Manuals](NCCH#cfa "wikilink") which
store the product code at the end of the 'Health & Safety' section of
the manual. However, product codes can differ from the above format as
shown below:

CTR-\[P/N/T/U\]-\[Type\]\[Game ID\]\[Region\]-\[Region\]-\[Digit\]

CTR-\[Type\]\[Game ID\]\[Region\]-\[Region\]-\[Digit\]

- P/N/T/U - Same as in product code structure
- \[Type\]\[Game ID\]\[Region\] - Same as in serial structure
- \[Region\] - A three character representation of the title region,
  i.e. 'EUR' (not always present)
- \[Digit\] - A single digit usually '1' or '0' (not always present).
  Possibly revision or manual revision.

**Note:** These alternate versions of the product code, potentially
found in [Electronic Manuals](NCCH#cfa "wikilink") don't represent the
actual product code, as found in the game's CXI. They are only found in
the game's Home Menu manual, and on the game's packaging and external
labeling.
