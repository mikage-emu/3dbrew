This is a wifi beacon exploit for Super Smash Bros 3DS (full-game), see
[here](https://github.com/yellows8/3ds_smashbroshax) for details. The
hb-launcher payload can only be properly booted on New3DS-only
currently, see the repo for details. The demo isn't usable with the
release-archives since the demo doesn't have SD access(you must build it
yourself with the PAYLOADURL option).
