A two-megabyte disk image containing a raw FAT12 partition, dedicated to
the **internal storage for voice memos**.

The proprietary format is backwards compatible with DSi software, but
not with most 3DS software capable of accessing voice memos on the SD
card.

[Nintendo 3DS Sound](Nintendo_3DS_Sound "wikilink") can be used to
import and export audio from internal storage.

Any 3DS-mode application capable of mounting [shared extdata
f0000002](Extdata "wikilink") can also access the files, in M4A format
according to the naming conventions of recordings on SD (folders are not
used).
