I'm not a dev, but I see potential for custom firmware of something like
Priiloader on the Wii, It would be able to trick the bootloader to load
to a specific point, bypassing the 3DS MENU security features. Tell me
if this makes sense?


I don't see the potential you are talking about. No, it does not make
sense.--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 14:40, 22

You don't even know what you're talking about. (and no it doesn't make
sense) --[Luigi2us](User:Luigi2us "wikilink") 15:37, 22 February 2012
