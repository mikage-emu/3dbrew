Hi there Crediar, I've been watching you succeed and succeed in the Wii
hacking community, I'm amazed by the things you have accomplished, if we
would be able to do 30% of what can be done to the Wii I'd be more then
happy. FC is 3523 - 2027 - 7900

Wow, you got a Save Tool out already?! Awesome!

Hi there, Crediar. I have been looking your work on the 3DS. Very good
work. I was thinking if you could make a homebrew for DSi to extract and
send data to the PC like you did with the Save Tool.

Oh yea, here is my Friend Code 2277-6646-9164

Hi,I'm [Matyapiro](メインページ "wikilink").I am Japanese. My friend
code:4339-2455-6521 I confirmed 3DSaveTool ver.0.2b does not work for
Japanese Game. It may be able to find a key,but try to decrypt
savefile,an exception has occured.


Make sure syntax is correct. It crashes if the commandline isn't
formatted correctly. You can place filenames in quotes if absolutely
necessary.

Hi, crediar! Did you dump a 3DS ROM without Legacy's rom dumper? Is this
correct? --[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 21:46, 1

Writing new saves to the card doesn't work. The games says that the
saves are corrupted! maybe that's a region problem? However, I used EUR
saves for a EUR game! --[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink")
