## 3DS DSiWare Titles

Would you mind if I add (a small amount, occasionally) DSi Title
Versions and DSi-only title IDs to this article or would it be out of
its scope? --[Hiccup](User:Hiccup "wikilink")

DSiBrew has all the relevant DSiWare titles. [3DS DSiWare
Titles](3DS_DSiWare_Titles "wikilink") is for keeping track of those
titles that were ported to 3DS only.

## DSi CDN exhaustive title/version list

Did you create these pastebins: <https://pastebin.com/kw6FH5cn>
<https://pastebin.com/8iR1tEm7> ? I saw that the dates matched up
approximately with some of your edits of [3DS DSiWare
Titles](3DS_DSiWare_Titles "wikilink"). Are they up-to-date? A couple
seem to have duplicates with non-existent versions listed, such as
000300044B323245 . How did you gather the info? Was it from the DSi Shop
(if that is still functional) or did you spider the CDN (if that is
realistic)? --[Hiccup](User:Hiccup "wikilink")
