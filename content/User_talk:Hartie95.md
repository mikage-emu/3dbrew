Hey Guys,

Does somebody know how to open the "System Data Archives" like "cver"
and "nver"? I would like to make it possible to check the firmware
version that a patch needs in the
[freeMultiPatcher](https://github.com/hartmannaf/Free-multi-Patcher),
and I would like to differ between firmware and kernel Version, because
of things like firmlaunch. Otherwise there could be a wrong
interpretation of the for example used home menu.

And with the possibility to allow the user to add own patch files that
will be loaded from the SD in the next update, it would be better to
have such mechanisms.
