Please think carefully before documenting service functions. Most of
your documentation doesn't even make sense. An "Index Word" is capable
to hold only one u32 value. Therefore, a large structure must span
multiple words. You can refer to some of my revision to your previous
documentation. --[Wwylele](User:Wwylele "wikilink")

(Reply to the one on my talk page) Right. Just a reminder that
[FRDU:GetMyMii](FRDU:GetMyMii "wikilink") and
[FRDU:GetMyFavoriteGame](FRDU:GetMyFavoriteGame "wikilink") still need
to fix. --[Wwylele](User:Wwylele "wikilink")
