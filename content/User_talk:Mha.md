Forwarded message from [Winmaster](User:Winmaster "wikilink"):

Hello Neimod; I have been having issues with the dsibrew wiki. I cannot
confirm my email address, and as a result, I cannot edit the wiki. I
have noticed you performing administrative duties on dsibrew as well as
3dbrew and I ask that you please look into the issue for me. Please note
that I have tried several email addresses including the one I use here
and on wiibrew. The following is the error I receive:

<div style="border: 1pt dashed blue; background : grey; padding: 1em 1em;">

### Confirm e-mail address

DSiBrew could not send your confirmation mail. Please check your e-mail
address for invalid characters.

Mailer returned: Failed to add recipient: \*removed\* \[SMTP: Invalid
response code received from server (code: 554, response:
\<\*removed\*\>: Relay access denied)\]

</div>

If you do not handle these issues, then could you please forward this
request to someone who does? Thanks,
