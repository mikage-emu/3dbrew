I hate it so much when I miss-use the apostrophe in "its". After
thinking making the same mistake in the announcement, I went back to
check to see if I did. I saw the apostrophe not there, I thought I did
it right. I was quite chuffed with myself, that was until I checked
recent history :/. Sorry for making so many apostrophe miss-uses. I see
you've cleaned a lot of mine up--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 16:49,
