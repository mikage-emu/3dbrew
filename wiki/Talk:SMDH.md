Thanks for clearing this up, yellows8! I remember if I saw the SMDH
magic in CIAs and wondered why its structure was in CIAs
only...--[Lazymarek9614](User:Lazymarek9614 "wikilink") 15:47, 9 April

"*while CIA icons are only displayed while selecting CIAs from SD card
on a dev 3DS*" When selecting CIA files from a SD card on my Dev 3DS, I
don't see any icons. (rev 37904)--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink")

Where are those CIA icons displayed then?(fix that on the page as
needed) --[Yellows8](User:Yellows8 "wikilink") 05:57, 12 April 2012

I'm not quite sure what they are for, As I have changed the icons and
names in a CIA file, then installed it. And during the process of
installing it I never saw the changed icons or names anywhere. My best
guess is that they are dummies put there so devs can double check the
CIA contains the app that the dev wants. Maybe Nintendo plans to utilise
the dummy icons and names in future version of Dev Menu, but at the
moment every Dev Menu revsion I have used/seen has not utilised the
dummy icons or names at all.--[3dsguy](User:3dsguy "wikilink") 11:36, 12
